0, 347, 540.021110982: Not a day goes by without another reporter breathlessly reporting some new machine learning product that is going to trounce human intelligence

1, 639, 537.978547007: “It was initially because computers at the time didn’t have much storage, so you couldn’t ship gigantic games,” he explains

2, 619, 537.434209257: And to me, just creating this name felt like creating a whole character

3, 213, 536.925854437: He also appeared on Saturday at the end of a panel with the cast and show creators of the HBO series "Westworld

4, 108, 536.421745569: "We wanted to treat ["Westworld"] a little more like a film franchise, and the only way I know to do that is to change the game every season," Nolan said.

5, 348, 536.416733637: That surfeit of enthusiasm doesn’t originate just with journalists though — they are merely channeling the wild optimism of researchers and startup founders alike.

6, 664, 536.38171342: “As far as the future goes, I certainly hope that generative media becomes more mainstream,” he says, but notes that his own sense of enjoyment comes not from consuming generative media, but creating it

7, 661, 536.355598092: “In the future, I’m sure we’ll have podcasts that are generated by machines that no one listens to, and they’ll disappear because it won’t be worth the electricity,” says Champandard

8, 563, 536.286805481: He says that they’ve already begun production for the devices.

10, 355, 535.868237242: Furthermore, the accuracy numbers reported in the popular press are often misleading, and a more nuanced evaluation of the data would show that many AI applications have much more limited capabilities than we have been led to believe

11, 643, 535.312540755: Ryan says he mainly uses what’s sometimes called symbolic AI or, pejoratively, “good old-fashioned AI.” This approach is less about mining data to look for patterns, as with deep learning, and more about creating sets of rules and logical instructions that guide a process.

12, 654, 534.928269058: But, he suggests that in the near future, AI won’t really be able to generate new content for us, whether it’s TV shows or podcasts

13, 399, 534.165883541: “Human-level” doesn’t say anything — there is rarely good data on the error rate of humans, and even when there is such data, it is often hard to compare the types of errors made by humans versus those made by machine learning.

14, 95, 533.693567857: That is why we did it
