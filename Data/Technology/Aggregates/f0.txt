The NCAA tournament selection committee doesn't have an easy job. But considering the euphoria of playing in the Big Dance and how critical matchups are for advancing to the second weekend, well, the cast of decision-makers isn't getting off the hook that easy.

While the committee got a good chunk of things right on Selection Sunday — bubble teams Arizona State and Oklahoma making the field because November and December legitimately matter and a majority of the top seeding lines on point — there's plenty of nitpicking to go over from 2018's pairings.

THE BRACKET: See all the NCAA tournament matchups | Printable

REGION CAPSULES: East | Midwest | South | West

BIGGEST SNUBS: Seven teams that had strong case to make NCAA field

COMMITTEE MISTAKES: Five teams that were either underseeded or overseeded

BRACKET ANALYSIS: Selection committee valued early wins, not late failures

Here's a look at five things the selection committee got wrong.

1. Syracuse is not a tourney team. Not even close.

The Orange do not belong in the field of 68. Perhaps last year's snub and 2016's Final Four run following the program's bubble inclusion were in the back of their heads. Whatever the case, it's head-scratching to rationalize this resume over the likes of USC, Middle Tennessee and even fellow ACC teams Notre Dame and Louisville.

The Orange’s best win came against Clemson late in the season, but outside of that victory there wasn't a ton of eye-raising material. ‘Cuse (20-13, 8-10) did have four Quadrant 1 wins and a top-20 non-conference strength of schedule — clearly features the committee valued.

2. West Virginia and Texas Tech could have switched No. 3 and No. 5.

The Mountaineers should have been a protected seed -- on the No. 4 line -- at the very least. Heck, their profile was good enough to possibly be ahead of Texas Tech, which snagged a No. 3 seed. WVU had better overall credentials and beat TTU twice. Maybe it was three losses to Kansas that the committee pinpointed.

CINDERELLAS: Five mid-majors that could bust brackets

TANKERS: Five ranked teams that could have trouble

3. Gonzaga didn't deserve that No. 4 seed, sorry.

Listen, the 'Zags have had a nice season in a horrible mid-major conference, the West Coast (that's why Saint Mary's got snubbed despite a 28-win profile). But the fact of the matter is there were just better teams on the No. 5 line that should have taken that spot. West Virginia is one of them. So was Kentucky, which looked really impressive in cutting down the nets in the SEC tournament championship on Sunday. Think about this: WVU played in the country's best RPI conference and UK played in the fourth-best RPI league. Gonzaga played in the nation's 13th worst conference. No non-conference schedule (the 'Zags beat Ohio State, Texas and Creighton) can make up for that.

4. Creighton and Florida State were overseeded big time.

The Bluejays probably didn't even deserve to be in the field of 68, but a correct seeding line would have been No. 10 or No. 11. How the committee came up with No. 8 is perplexing. Did that Villanova victory count twice? Same story with Florida State, a team that realistically should have been one of the last teams in the field based on a horrendous non-conference strength of schedule of 314. A No. 9 seed? Really? St. Bonaventure, which drew a No. 11 seed after a solid season in the Atlantic 10, should have undoubtedly taken one of those better seeds.

5. Florida and Houston should've been higher than No. 6.

Perhaps it's a blessing in disguise for these teams that they didn't end up on the No. 5 line, where No. 12 seed Cinderella upsets are more frequent than the No. 11 line. But still, what was the committee looking at here? Did it not watch Houston's AAC tournament showing, in which it knocked off Wichita State and went toe-to-toe with Cincinnati? And the Gators, which bowed out early in the SEC tournament, still had a résumé worthy of a No. 5 based on nine Quadrant 1 wins.

All the stuff you can do with iPhone 8 that you couldn’t with iPhone 7
A glut of iPhone 8 and 8 Plus reviews are no doubt hitting your social media streams right now, and it’s hard to keep track of all those opinions. While talking about design, experience, and “feel,” are important, the key question remains: What does this phone let you do that your old phone didn’t? Here’s what you’re missing out on by sticking with your older hardware.

Charge wirelessly

The iPhone 8 series phones have glass backs once again (like the iPhone4!), and underneath that smooth skin are the guts it takes to charge wirelessly. Apple uses the Qi platform, which should seem familiar to pretty much anyone who has ever used wireless charging on anything, including Android phones. This works great when you’re sleeping and the phone is sitting on your bedside table, but since the device has to sit on the pad the whole time, you can’t use your phone in a normal way. It’s useful in the car, but it’s worth noting that it won’t work with CarPlay right now (unless you have a specific BMW), which will continue to be the case until more vehicles become compatible. So, don’t throw away that Lightning cable in your car just yet.

Use Bluetooth 5 gadgets

If you’re using a current generation iPhone, you’re using Bluetooth 4, which was a considerable step forward thanks to its reduced power usage. The iPhone 8 series moves up to Bluetooth 5, which promises a more reliable and efficient connection, especially when it comes to smart home gadgets. The drawback, however, is that there really aren’t any compatible Bluetooth 5 gadgets to pair it with just yet. The phone will still work fine with legacy Bluetooth products of course, but this is a feature that won’t pay off for a while.

Charge faster

The charger that comes with the iPhone 8 is the same white 5W brick it has always been. But if you have access to a higher-powered charger like the one from an iPad Pro or even a USB-C MacBook, you can now juice up your phone more rapidly. It’s unclear if this will affect overall battery life and durability (rapid charging has historically had a negative effect on batteries), but it’s great if you need to power up quickly. Reports have found you can get roughly 50 percent battery charge in about 30 minutes if you use a 29W USB-C charger for a MacBook Pro on the iPhone 8.

Shoot fancier video

The cameras inside the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus have been upgraded, and Apple has announced some small hardware tweaks, but those changes are manifested primarily as a spec bump in video capture. You can now grab 240 fps slow-motion video at full HD (1080p), whereas the iPhone 7 could only manage 720p. The 8 and 8 Plus also shoot 4K video at 60p, which requires it to move and process a lot of pixels, which is possible thanks to the speed increase that comes from upgrades like the new A11 Bionic processor. In short: The camera is faster when shooting video.

A noticeably distraught and disgruntled Southern California coach Andy Enfield addressed reporters at a news conference following Selection Sunday’s unveiling, which stunningly kept the Trojans out of the field of 68 — perhaps the worst snub of the night. USC’s RPI of 34 and strong finish — reaching the Pac-12 tourney final vs. Arizona — made it particularly perplexing.

“Our team is very disappointed,” Enfield said. “We deserve to be in the NCAA tournament.”

Enfield started off calm while talking passionately about his team and its credentials that made USC worthy of going dancing.

But his emotion picked up midway through and he was clearly frustrated with the committee’s lack of transparency.

“If all that matters is the quality of your best win on your schedule, than we shouldn’t even play,” Enfield jabbed at the committee. “Set the field in December after non-conference is complete. (The selection committee) basically discredited our entire (Pac-12) league schedule. No matter what we or some of the other teams in Pac-12 tournament did, it obviously didn’t matter.

Andy Enfield expresses shock, dismay over USC not making the tournament and what he says is a complete discredit to the Pac-12 conference. pic.twitter.com/NpGuwydqfp — Lindsey Thiry (@LindseyThiry) March 11, 2018

“We came in second in the Pac-12, a major conference, outright. And then played in the (conference) championship game. … Our RPI is No. 34 in the nation. Our strength of schedule is a 37 which is extremely tough — much tougher than teams in tournament. Teams that made the tournament had RPIs in the 60s and 70s. We have 11 wins away from home. Supposedly, road wins and neutral wins are valued.”

TEHRAN, Iran — A Turkish private jet flying from the United Arab Emirates to Istanbul carrying a group of young women crashed Sunday night in a mountainous region of Iran during a heavy rain, killing all 11 people on board, authorities said. The doomed aircraft days earlier carried a bachelorette party bound for Dubai.

Iranian state television quoted Mojtaba Khaledi, the spokesman of the country’s emergency management organization, as saying the plane hit a mountain near Shahr-e Kord and burst into flames. Shahr-e Kord is 230 miles south of the capital, Tehran.

Khaledi later told a website associated with state TV that local villagers had reached the site in the Zagros Mountains and found only badly burned bodies and no survivors. He said DNA tests would be needed to identify the dead.

Villagers near the crash earlier said they saw flames coming from the plane’s engine before the crash, according to a report by Iran’s state-run judiciary news agency Mizan.

The plane took off around 4:41 p.m. (9:11 a.m. EST) Sunday and reached a cruising altitude of just over 35,000 feet, according to FlightRadar24, a flight-tracking website. At around 6:01 p.m. (10:31 a.m. EST), something appears to have gone wrong with the flight as it rapidly gained altitude and then dropped drastically within minutes, data published by the website showed.

The General Civil Aviation Authority in the UAE said the flight took off from Sharjah International Airport on its way to Istanbul. A private company that handles public relations for the Sharjah airfield, the home of low-cost airline Air Arabia, declined to immediately comment. Sharjah is a neighboring emirate of Dubai.

Turkey’s private Dogan News Agency identified the plane as a Bombardier CL604, tail number TC-TRB. Turkey’s Transport Ministry said the plane belongs to a company named Basaran Holding, which the Associated Press could not immediately reach.

Basaran Investment Holding is active in the food, finance, energy, construction, tourism and travel industries, according to the company’s website.

Mina Basaran, 28, the daughter of Basaran’s chairman who is part of the company’s board of managers and is in line to run the business, posted photographs on Instagram of what appeared to be her bachelorette party in Dubai.

Among those photographs was an image of the plane posted three days ago. In it, Basaran poses on the tarmac carrying flowers, wearing a denim jacket reading “Mrs. Bride” and the hashtag “#bettertogether.” In another picture, she holds heart-shaped balloons inside the plane.

One day ago, Basaran posted a picture with seven smiling friends from a Dubai resort. The last videos posted to her account showed her and friends enjoying a concert by the British pop star Rita Ora at a popular Dubai nightclub. There was no further activity on her account after that.

It wasn’t clear who was on the plane at the time of the crash, though Iranian emergency management officials described all the passengers as being young women, according to IRNA.

Sunday’s crash comes after an Iranian ATR-72, a twin-engine turboprop used for short-distance regional flying, crashed in southern Iran, killing all 65 people on board in February.

Fortnite PS4 vs. Xbox One cross-play isn’t happening, but both consoles can play against PC or mobile
The ongoing saga between Sony and Microsoft’s cross-play battles has taken another twist today. Epic Games originally announced cross-play and cross-progression earlier this week between the PlayStation 4, PC, Mac, iOS, and eventually the Android versions of the game. While Microsoft’s Xbox One was missing from the list, the company revealed last night that it will support cross-play on Fortnite for Xbox and that it will be available in the future.

Unfortunately, that cross-play won’t happen between PlayStation 4 and Xbox One players. Epic Games’ Nick Chester revealed on Twitter today that Xbox One players will only be able to play Fortnite with PC, Mac, and mobile players, and PS4 players will also be limited to play against PC, Mac, and mobile. It’s now clear that PS4 vs. Xbox One Fortnite cross-play will not be supported, despite there being no technical reason it can’t work. Epic Games briefly enabled the cross-play last year, and PS4 and Xbox One gamers were able to play against each other due to a “configuration issue.”

Xbox One players can play with PC, Mac, and mobile.

Sony vs. Microsoft on cross-play

Microsoft has publicly committed to cross-play, and has pushed Sony to allow PS4 players to play against Xbox One gamers. Still, it’s unlikely that Microsoft would be encouraging this type of cross-network play if it was still in a position of power and selling the most consoles in the US each month. Sony has previously refused to enable cross-play between PS4 and Xbox One for both Rocket League and Minecraft, despite Microsoft and Nintendo both supporting it across Xbox One, PC, and Switch. Sony’s excuse for blocking PlayStation and Xbox cross-platform play was hostile, blaming “exposing what in many cases are children to external influences we have no ability to manage or look after.”

That excuse is no longer valid with Fortnite cross-play between PS4, PC, Mac, and mobile, but it’s not clear why Sony, Epic Games, or Microsoft isn’t supporting PS4 vs. Xbox One. It’s likely there’s a complicated set of reasons, ranging from Sony’s competitive advantage over Xbox One sales, to Microsoft’s console exclusive with Playerunknown’s Battlegrounds. Epic Games is dodging the question right now, and Sony and Microsoft aren’t being upfront about the reasons. It’s a sad state of affairs that mutual customers and friends can’t play a game they enjoy with each other because of corporate politics, but it looks like it’s just another day in the video game industry.

Xbox One X and Xbox One S will soon support AMD FreeSync displays
Microsoft is adding support for AMD’s FreeSync displays to its Xbox One X and Xbox One S consoles soon. The upcoming Xbox spring update already includes 1440p support on the Xbox One S and Xbox One X for monitors, but the addition of FreeSync will allow compatible displays to sync refresh rates with Microsoft’s consoles.

FreeSync, like Nvidia’s G-Sync, helps remove tearing or stuttering usually associated with gaming on monitors, as the technology syncs refresh rates to ensure games run smooth. FreeSync and G-Sync are widely used on PC gaming systems and monitors, so the addition of 1440p resolution and FreeSync will appeal to Xbox owners who also have a gaming display.

Alongside the FreeSync addition, Microsoft is also planning to support auto low latency mode on TVs. This will allow compatible TVs, available later this year, to recognize when a game is being played and turn on game mode, or low latency mode to optimize gaming. Microsoft demonstrated this during the company’s Inside Xbox stream today, and the mode will switch back once a game isn’t running. This is particularly useful if you use Netflix or other media apps on an Xbox One, as game mode will be automatically disabled once you switch back to these types of apps.

Sony’s three-player virtual air hockey table is a peek at the future of augmented reality
Sony is back in Austin this week for SXSW, the annual tech and entertainment meet-up, with a entire warehouse of weird gadgets, games, and prototypes that all rely, in one way or another, on Sony technology. The exhibit, called the Wow Factory, is an opportunity for the Japanese tech giant’s engineers and artists to collaborate on experimental projects.

These projects are meant to emphasize how Sony’s display technology, particularly its advancements in image sensors and projectors, can be stretched and morphed into hardware and software that goes far beyond a standard image on a flat screen. In this way, Sony is able to dabble in areas like augmented reality by using interactive holograms instead of requiring users to wear bulky glasses or helmets. It achieves this by using projectors and sensors that track motion and measure depth and pressure to let you interact with objects made entirely of light.

Sony achieves AR using image sensors and projectors, not glasses or helmets

One such example is a three-way augmented reality air hockey game Sony developed specifically for the Wow Factory this year. The game features a physical hockey puck and three physical paddles around custom circular table. But the table is also making use of two of Sony’s new IMX382 visual sensors, which can detect and track objects at 1,000 frames per second. One sensor sits above the table to track the puck, and another sits below to track players’ paddles. An overhead projector meanwhile overlays the game interface and virtual pucks onto the surface of the table.

This sensor setup is similar to the one contained in Sony’s experimental projectors that it’s brought to SXSW in past exhibits. In those situations, Sony has turned tabletops into touchscreens and created interactive software that overlays onto physical props. For instance, Sony used a copy of Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland alongside a physical deck of playing cards and a teacup to bring to life the happenings described in the text. The company also built an architectural demo that could turn a standard block of wood into a top-down scale model of a home, with the light shining down onto the table to color and annotate the objects in real time.

In the case of the AR air hockey game, Sony’s software allows the real hockey puck to interact with the virtual ones because the image sensors track both your hand and the paddle as you interact with the objects on the table. So you can hit the virtual pucks with your paddle as if they real, and the virtual ones even bounce off of the real puck and the sides of the table in realistic fashion.

The game itself is a chaotic one in which all three players are simultaneously defending their own goal and going on the offensive against their opponents. All the while, a half-dozen hockey pucks — all but one of which are made out of light — fly around the table and collide in a nonstop frenzy.

While it’s not ever going to be a commercial product, Sony has shown time and again that its display and sensor tech can achieve a novel form of AR. These demos show the extent to which sensor data and the right mix of hardware can create immersive experiences that don’t rely on blasting light in your eyes or plastering a screen on your face. AR is often thought of as something that will only truly arrive when it’s packed into a standard pair of eye glasses. And yet right now, the common conception of the technology is the selfie filters and other animations you get on Snapchat and other apps, as well as the clumsy mixing of real and virtual objects through a smartphone lens like with Niantic’s Pokémon Go.

But Sony’s showcase here at SXSW illustrates how AR can be achieved through alternative means, if you’re wiling to expand how you think about the term and what it requires to realistic function.

Sony’s wild AR hologram tech continues to get better and better
Sony has made it a point to come to SXSW, the annual Austin-based tech and culture meet-up, every year with a warehouse full of weird gadgets, demos, games, and other interactive experiences. This year was no different, as Sony opened the doors yesterday on the Wow Factory, its name for the wide-ranging exhibit that blends art and technology borne from its experimental, Japan-based Future Lab program. The experiences in the Wow Factory tend to center on Sony’s display tech, specifically its advances in projectors that ultimately seem to have manifested as a pricey consumer product called the Xperia Touch.

But Sony hasn’t stopped pushing the limits of the tech. The core premise is that with a mix of smart sensors that perform depth detection and motion tracking with a high-quality light source, you can create the closest thing we have today to interactive holograms. The projectors create objects out of light that typically exist on a flat plane either in front of the projector or below on a tabletop. You can interact with these virtual objects using your hands because the projector’s software is able to recognize and track your movements. Effectively, Sony has figured out a way to make augmented reality without requiring you wear bulky goggles or goofy smart glasses.

Going one step further, Sony has designed custom demos that make use of real-world objects. Sony returned to Austin this year with a collaborate music game that combines four of its projectors into a single cohesive system. With small 3D models of instruments, including a miniature saxophone and a piano, users can work together to play a series of songs by directing spotlights to each instrument. The small 3D-printed models are recognized by the software and come to life under the projectors’ light, while other sensors track your finger motions as you move the spotlight around the table.

The demo is not at all practical, because it requires custom software and custom props. And no consumer would ever spend many thousands of dollars to outfit a table with four of Sony’s prototype projectors just to pull off silly games and tech proof-of-concepts like this. But it is a genuinely impressive demonstration, as each object placed under the projectors’ light and within range of the system’s sensors is brought to life in a way that looks and feels like the closest manifestation of software in the real world.

it’s also a great example of how to take an alternative approach to AR. Something like this is both more accessible and can be experienced collectively, without requiring everybody wear a pair of smart glasses, a VR-style helmet, or even a compatible smartphone with the requisite software. Sony’s approach here is akin to a hologram — it exists physically as light in a 3D space that everyone can see and interact with.

Sony has been working on this tech for a while. It’s mostly a marketing stunt to showcase its experimental hardware, but over the years, we’ve seen the full breadth of what this tech allows. We saw Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland jump off the page and interact with physical objects like a teacup and a deck of cards in 2016, and last year, Sony built an architectural demo to show the enterprise use cases of its projector tech, as a standard block of wood was transformed into a top-down scale model of a home.

This year, Sony engineers took the lessons the company picked up with the Xperia Touch and its prior demos to develop a three-person virtual hockey game. The custom circular table is equipped with a standard projector with its new image IMX382 image sensors to track the puck and paddles, while the projector creates a virtual interface that reacts to your physical movements.

We don’t know whether this tech will ever turn into a viable mainstream consumer product — the mini-projector Sony sells now capable of running these AR-style hologram demos costs about $1,700. And without a true reason to own one or develop applications for it, it’ll never take off in the way AR apps on iOS and Android can, thanks to software frameworks like Apple’s ARKit and Google’s ARCore. But if Sony does find a way to commercialize this tech, it could pave the way for a unique and novel way to create immersive, collaborate AR experiences that can be deployed using everyday objects and on something as ordinary as a kitchen table. That’s exciting, if it ever does leave the quirky demo phase it exists here in Austin.

Sony’s wild AR hologram tech continues to get better and better
Sony has made it a point to come to SXSW, the annual Austin-based tech and culture meet-up, every year with a warehouse full of weird gadgets, demos, games, and other interactive experiences. This year was no different, as Sony opened the doors yesterday on the Wow Factory, its name for the wide-ranging exhibit that blends art and technology borne from its experimental, Japan-based Future Lab program. The experiences in the Wow Factory tend to center on Sony’s display tech, specifically its advances in projectors that ultimately seem to have manifested as a pricey consumer product called the Xperia Touch.

But Sony hasn’t stopped pushing the limits of the tech. The core premise is that with a mix of smart sensors that perform depth detection and motion tracking with a high-quality light source, you can create the closest thing we have today to interactive holograms. The projectors create objects out of light that typically exist on a flat plane either in front of the projector or below on a tabletop. You can interact with these virtual objects using your hands because the projector’s software is able to recognize and track your movements. Effectively, Sony has figured out a way to make augmented reality without requiring you wear bulky goggles or goofy smart glasses.

Going one step further, Sony has designed custom demos that make use of real-world objects. Sony returned to Austin this year with a collaborate music game that combines four of its projectors into a single cohesive system. With small 3D models of instruments, including a miniature saxophone and a piano, users can work together to play a series of songs by directing spotlights to each instrument. The small 3D-printed models are recognized by the software and come to life under the projectors’ light, while other sensors track your finger motions as you move the spotlight around the table.

The demo is not at all practical, because it requires custom software and custom props. And no consumer would ever spend many thousands of dollars to outfit a table with four of Sony’s prototype projectors just to pull off silly games and tech proof-of-concepts like this. But it is a genuinely impressive demonstration, as each object placed under the projectors’ light and within range of the system’s sensors is brought to life in a way that looks and feels like the closest manifestation of software in the real world.

it’s also a great example of how to take an alternative approach to AR. Something like this is both more accessible and can be experienced collectively, without requiring everybody wear a pair of smart glasses, a VR-style helmet, or even a compatible smartphone with the requisite software. Sony’s approach here is akin to a hologram — it exists physically as light in a 3D space that everyone can see and interact with.

Netflix is testing a badge scheme to turn your kids into binge watchers
What better way to turn your kids into binge watchers than by turning Netflix into a badge-collection scheme? That's apparently the thinking behind a new feature currently being tested on the video streaming service, which rewards children with stickers when they watch certain shows.

According to a report from Variety, those involved in the test see red padlocks on the top of TV shows that can earn them a badge. At the moment at least, that's all the reward that they get – there's no other incentive to race through a whole series of Paw Patrol.

It would seem that only a small subsection of Netflix users have the feature enabled for the time being, so it's by no means definite that this is going to roll out for everyone. Netflix is always keen for viewers young and old to spend as much time as possible on the platform though, so it would make sense.

"A more interactive experience"

"We are testing a new feature on select kids titles that introduces collectible items for a more interactive experience, adding an element of fun and providing kids something to talk about and share around the titles they love," Netflix told Variety. "We learn by testing and this feature may or may not become part of the Netflix experience."

Some parents have taken to social media to complain that the scheme is going to make it harder to pull kids away from their various screens, while others have reported that the introduction of badges is definitely working for Netflix.

Netflix recently introduced improved parental controls so moms and dads can block specific TV shows or movies they don't want their kids watching. Maturity ratings are also going to become more visible before a title starts playing, giving parents a better idea of what to expect before they start watching.

Best Round of 64 matchup: The 8-9 pairing is usually a solid choice, and the Virginia Tech-Alabama clash shouldn’t disappoint. Collin Sexton can be one of the most dynamic players in the country when healthy, and he has been down the stretch. The Hokies have figured some things out as the season has progressed, most notably how to defense the interior.

THE BRACKET: See all the NCAA tournament matchups | Printable

REGION CAPSULES: East | Midwest | South | West

BIGGEST SNUBS: Seven teams that had strong case to make NCAA field

BRACKET ANALYSIS: Selection committee valued early wins, not late failures

Potential upset: Stephen F. Austin is under new management but is still a known giant killer. Texas Tech struggled with injuries in February, most notably to top playmaker Keenan Evans. Though the Red Raiders looked healthier in the Big 12 tournament, they might still be vulnerable. If the Lumberjacks are at all close, they’ll likely pick up support from the home-state crowd in Dallas.

The sleeper: West Virginia will have its hands full just getting out of its opening tilt with a strong Murray State squad, not to mention a potential round-of-32 clash with Wichita State. But if the Mountaineers advance far enough to earn a Sweet 16 date with Villanova, they might just be the kind of team that can pose problems for the Wildcats with their pressing defense. Whether WVU could make enough shots to keep up would be the biggest question, but the matchup could have the potential to ruin a few brackets.

The winner: With that in mind, however, the top-seeded Wildcats appear to have regained the form that had them atop the polls for much of the season. Look for Villanova to erase the memory of last year’s disappointing second-round exit and make it back to the Final Four. They are going for their second national championship in three years.

The teams

1. Villanova

Nickname: Wildcats. Location: Villanova, Pa.

Record: 30-4, 14-4. Bid: Big East champ.

Last appearance: 2017, lost to Wisconsin in round of 32.

Coach: Jay Wright (21-13 in 14 appearances).

Overview: It’s been feast or famine for the Wildcats recently in the tournament, either going all the way or flaming out early. The fate of this year’s group will hinge on its biggest strength. Quite simply, they can shoot the lights out, better than 50% overall and almost 40% from the arc. They also convert at a 77% clip from the free-throw line. The problem: Defense can be suspect when shots aren’t falling.

Projected starters: G Jalen Brunson, 6-3, Jr. (19.4 ppg, 3.1 rpg, 4.7 apg, 53.1 FG%, 41.3 3FG%); G Mikal Bridges, 6-6, Jr. (18.0 ppg, 5.4 rpg, 52.1 FG%, 43.3 FG%); G Phil Booth, 6-3, Jr. (10.9 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 2.8 apg); F Omari Spellman, 6-9, Fr. (10.7 ppg, 7.9 rpg); F Eric Paschall, 6-9, Jr. (10.3 ppg, 5.1 rpg).

2. Purdue

Nickname: Boilermakers. Location: West Lafayette, Ind.

Record: 28-6, 15-3. Bid: Big Ten at-large.

Last appearance: 2017, lost to Kansas in Sweet 16.

Coach: Matt Painter (11-10 in 10 appearances).

Overview: The Boilermakers won 19 in a row and looked like the Big Ten’s best before a three-game skid in early February. They responded by winning six in a row before falling to red-hot Michigan in the Big Ten tournament final. Sophomore Carsen Edwards has emerged as an All-American, giving Purdue the alpha dog scorer it needs for a deep March run. The Boilermakers rank second nationally in three-point field goal percentage (42%).

Projected starters: G P.J. Thompson, 5-10, Sr. (7.1 ppg, 85.2 FT%); G Dakota Mathias, 6-4, Sr. (12.4 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 4.1 apg, 46.4 3FG%); G Carsen Edwards, 6-1, So. (18.5 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 41.2 3FG%); F Vincent Edwards, 6-8, Sr. (14.9 ppg, 7.3 rpg, 83.8 FT%); C Isaac Haas, 7-2, Sr., (14.9 ppg, 5.6 rpg, 62.1 FG%).

3. Texas Tech

Nickname: Red Raiders. Location: Lubbock.

Record: 24-9, 11-7. Bid: Big 12 at-large.

Last appearance: 2016, lost to Butler in Round of 64.

Coach: Chris Beard (1-1 in one appearance).

Overview: For a stretch in February, Texas Tech — a defense-first, veteran bunch — looked like the team to unlock Kansas’ Big 12 supremacy. Then when senior guard Keenan Evans hurt a toe; the Red Raiders lost four in a row, falling out of the Big 12 race and dropping a couple of seed lines, too. But if Evans is healthy, Texas Tech could make a run.

Projected starters: G Keenan Evans, 6-3, Sr. (17.5 ppg, 3.1 rpg, 3.2 apg, 80.9 FT%); G Zhaire Smith, 6-5, Fr. (11.2 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 41.9 3FG%); G Justin Gray, 6-6, Sr. (5.0 ppg, 3.4 rpg, 83.7 FT%); G Jarrett Culver, 6-5, Fr. (11.7 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 40.8 3FG%); C Norense Odiase, 6-9, Jr. (4.1 ppg, 4.7 rpg).

4. Wichita State

Nickname: Shockers. Location: Wichita.

Record: 25-7, 14-4. Bid: American at-large.

Last appearance: 2017, lost to Kentucky in Round of 32.

Coach: Gregg Marshall (11-13 in 13 appearances).

Overview: The Shockers’ first trip through their new league wasn’t always smooth. But the more challenging slate ultimately could serve them well, which was the reason for the change. As is the signature of Marshall’s teams, the Shockers aren’t afraid to dive on the floor after loose balls. But this group actually is more successful in a more free-flowing game when it can space the court and find open shooters.

Projected starters: G Landry Shamet, 6-4, So. (15.0 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 5.1 apg); G Conner Frankamp, 6-1, Sr. (10.1 ppg, 2.3 apg); C Shaquille Morris, 6-8, Sr. (14.0 ppg, 5.5 rpg); F Rashard Kelly, 6-7, Sr. (5.7 ppg, 7.5 rpg); F Zach Brown, 6-6, Sr. (4.7 ppg, 3.1 rpg).

5. West Virginia

Nickname: Mountaineers. Location: Morgantown.

Record: 24-20, 11-7. Bid: Big 12 at-large.

Last appearance: 2017, lost to Gonzaga in Sweet 16.

Coach: Bob Huggins (31-23 in 23 appearances).

Overview: West Virginia lives and dies with defense. Led by senior guard Jevon Carter, Big 12 defensive player of the year for the second season in a row, the Mountaineers’ smothering pressure is the key — especially because their offense has been frighteningly inconsistent. It might be this simple: How is the officiating? West Virginia can swarm and overwhelm opponents but can rack up fouls in a tightly called game.

Projected starters: G Jevon Carter, 6-2, Sr. (17.0 ppg, 4.8 rpg); G Daxter Miles Jr., 6-3, Sr. (12.7 ppg, 2.9 rpg); F Sagaba Konate, 6-8, So. (10.5 ppg, 7.7 rpg); F Esa Ahmad, 6-8, Jr. (10.6 ppg, 5.3 rpg); F Wesley Harris, 6-8, So. (5.8 ppg, 3.8 rpg).

6. Florida

Nickname: Gators. Location: Gainesville.

Record: 20-12, 11-7. Bid: SEC at-large.

Last appearance: 2017, lost to South Carolina in Elite Eight.

Coach: Mike White (3-1 in one appearance).

Overview: Florida is well-rounded and experienced. The Gators use a four-guard lineup that averages just 9.8 turnovers a game and are eighth overall in turnover margin. Rebounding is a problem: Florida is routinely beaten on the backboard. That can be costly in March.

Projected Starters: G Jalen Hudson, 6-6, Jr. (15.3 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 41.1 3FG%); G Egor Koulechov, 6-5, Sr. (13.6 ppg, 6.5 rpg, 40.3 3FG%, 87.4 FT%); G KeVaughn Allen, 6-2, Jr. (11.3 ppg, 2.4 rpg, 90.1 FT%); G Chris Chiozza, 6-0, Sr. (11.2 ppg, 4.4 rpg, 6.1 apg); F/C Kevarrius Hayes, 6-9, Jr. (4.9 ppg, 5.1 rpg, 57.3 FG%).

7. Arkansas

Nickname: Razorbacks. Location: Fayetteville.

Record: 23-11, 10-8. Bid: SEC at-large.

Last appearance: 2017, lost to North Carolina in Round of 32.

Coach: Mike Anderson (9-8 in eight appearances).

Overview: Arkansas enters the tournament with one of the top offensive units in the country, including two of the SEC’s five scorers (Jaylen Barford and Daryl Macon). Freshman Daniel Gafford is the only player on the team taller than 6-9, and he will be the X-factor, because the Razorbacks have struggled with rebounding.

Projected starters: G Jaylen Barford, 6-3, Sr. (18.2 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 43.2 3FG%); G Daryl Macon, 6-3, Sr. (16.8 ppg, 4.0 apg, 42.5 3FG%, 86.6 FT%); F Daniel Gafford, 6-11, Fr. (12.1 ppg, 6.2 rpg, 2.2 bpg); G Anton Beard, 6-0, Sr. (9.5 ppg, 3.1 apg); F Adrio Bailey, 6-7, So. (4.1 ppg, 2.6 rpg, 55.6 FG%).

8. Virginia Tech

Nickname: Hokies. Location: Blacksburg.

Record: 21-11, 10-8. Bid: ACC at-large.

Last appearance: 2017, lost to Wisconsin in Round of 64.

Coach: Buzz Williams (8-6 in six appearances).

Overview: The Hokies have been dangerous against some of the best teams, beating Virginia, Duke and North Carolina. Four starters average double figures, led by Justin Robinson, who tops the team in scoring and assists. There’s also strength off the bench with Ahmed Hill (10.8 ppg) and Chris Clarke (8.3 ppg, 6.5 rpg). One thing Virginia Tech lacks, however, is size besides Kerry Blackshear.

Projected starters: G Justin Robinson, 6-2, Jr. (13.8 ppg, 5.6 apg, 1.2 spg); G Justin Bibbs, 6-5, Sr. (13.1 ppg, 2.5 rpg); F Kerry Blackshear Jr., 6-10, So. (12.6 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 55.7 FG%); G Nickeil Alexander-Walker, 6-5, Fr. (10.5 ppg, 3.9 rpg); G Devin Wilson 6-4, Sr. (2.9 ppg, 53.8 FG%).

9. Alabama

Nickname: Crimson Tide. Location: Tuscaloosa.

Record: 19-15, 8-10. Bid: SEC at-large.

Last appearance: 2012, lost to Creighton in Round of 64.

Coach: Avery Johnson (first appearance).

Overview: Collin Sexton is one of the best guards in the country, and he has been excellent down the stretch. Alabama struggles from beyond the arc (32.5% from three) and is not a great rebounding team. For Alabama — in the tournament despite 15 losses — to advance, Sexton has to carry the Tide.

Projected starters: G Collin Sexton, 6-3, Fr. (19 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 3.6 apg); F Donta Hall, 6-9, Jr. (10.9 ppg, 6.8 rpg, 2.1 bpg, 72.1 FG%,); G Dazon Ingram, 6-5, So. (10.1 ppg, 5.7 rpg); G Herb Jones, 6-7, Fr. (4.3 ppg, 3.6 rpg); F Galin Smith, 6-9, Fr. (2.7 ppg, 2.0 rpg).

10. Butler

Nickname: Bulldogs. Location: Indianapolis.

Record: 20-13, 9-9. Bid: Big East at-large.

Last appearance: 2017, lost to North Carolina in Sweet 16.

Coach: LaVall Jordan (first appearance).

Overview: The phrase “the Butler way” gets bandied about a lot. There’s clearly something to it, as the Bulldogs keep finding their way to the Dance despite a succession of coaching changes. In his first year at the helm, Jordan has relied on his veteran leaders to keep the ship moving. They’ll struggle to shut down teams with athletic front courts, but they’ll usually make good decisions with the ball.

Projected starters: F Kelan Martin, 6-7, Sr. (20.8 ppg, 6.2 rpg, 83.1 FT%); G Kamar Baldwin, 6-1, So. (15.5 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 3.1 apg); F Tyler Wideman, 6-8, Sr. (9.4 ppg, 5.1 rpg); G Sean McDermott, 6-6, So. (7.3 ppg, 3.8 rpg); G Aaron Thompson, 6-2, Fr. (4.3 ppg, 3.2 apg).

11. St. Bonaventure

Nickname: Bonnies. Location: Allegany, N.Y.

Record: 25-7, 14-4. Bid: Atlantic-10 at-large.

Last appearance: 2012, lost to Florida State in Round of 64.

Coach: Mark Schmidt (0-1 in one appearance).

Overview: Once the Bonnies got healthy during the conference season, they lived up to the potential. Some early losses suffered when Jaylen Adams was sidelined with an ankle injury were nearly too much to overcome, but in the end their résumé was good enough. They can shoot with just about anyone, but they’ll be at a size disadvantage against most potential opponents.

Projected starters: G Jaylen Adams, 6-2, Sr. (19.8 ppg, 3.6 rpg, 5.4 apg); G Matt Mobley, 6-3, Sr. (18.5 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 2.5 apg); C Amadi Ikbeze, 6-10, So. (4.7 ppg, 3.1 rpg); G Idris Taqqee, 6-4, Sr. (5.4 ppg, 4.8 rpg); F Courtney Stockard, 6-5, Jr. (12.9 ppg, 6.4 rpg).

11. UCLA

Nickname: Bruins. Location: Los Angeles.

Record: 21-11, 11-7. Bid: Pac-12 at-large.

Last appearance: 2017, lost to Kentucky in Sweet 16.

Coach: Steve Alford (11-10 in 10 appearances).

Overview: The Bruins tend to seesaw between spectacular (win vs. Arizona on the road) and puzzling (a loss at Oregon State). But they know how to score, 82.4 points a game, and they have a big-time playmaker in Aaron Holiday. The question is if they can contain other teams in crunch time; they allow 76.3 ppg. UCLA has a history of success in the NCAA tournament, too: Besides all those national titles won under legendary coach John Wooden, the Bruins have been to the Sweet 16 three of the last four years.

Projected starters: G Aaron Holiday, 6-1, Jr. (20.3 ppg, 3.6 rpg, 5.8 apg, 43.3 3FG%, 82.6 FT%); G Kris Wilkes, 6-8, Fr. (13.8 ppg, 5.0 rpg); C Thomas Welsh, 7-0, Sr. (13.0 ppg, 10.7 rpg, 40.9 3FG%, 82.8 FT%); F Gyorgy Goloman, 6-11, Sr. (7.3 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 54.5 FG%, 42.9 3FG%); G Prince Ali, 6-3, So. (9.0 ppg, 3.1 rpg).

12. Murray State

Nickname: Racers. Location: Murray, Ky.

Record: 26-5, 16-2. Bid: Ohio Valley champ.

Last appearance: 2012, lost to Marquette in the Round of 32.

Coach: Matt McMahon, first appearance.

Overview: The Racers have won 13 in a row and dominated a strong Belmont team in the Ohio Valley tournament title game. Senior guard Jonathan Stark is an explosive scorer with takeover abilities, and do-everything guard Ja Morant has added a key ingredient to Murray State’s winning formula.

Projected starters: G Jonathan Stark, 6-0, Sr. (21.8 ppg, 3.9 apg, 88.8 FT%); G Ja Morant, 6-3, Fr. (12.6 ppg, 6.6 rpg, 6.4 apg); G Shaq Buchanan, 6-3, Jr. (9.2 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 51.4 FG%); F Terrell Miller Jr., 6-8, Sr. (14.7 ppg, 8.3 rpg); F Brion Sanchious, 6-8, Jr. (3.0 ppg, 2.8 rpg).

13. Marshall

Nickname: Thundering Herd. Location: Huntington, W.Va.

Record: 24-10, 12-6. Bid: Conference USA champ.

Last appearance: 1987, lost to TCU in Round of 64.

Coach: Dan D’Antoni (first appearance).

Overview: The Thundering Herd played spoiler in the C-USA tourney. But this team has some bracket-busting ammunition, with a dynamic offense that ranks in the top 10 in the nation in scoring (85 points a game). Only Marshall has two players who average more than 20 points a game — Jon Elmore and C.J. Burks. Marshall also protects the paint well, with Ajdin Penava, the nation’s leading shot blocker, there to disrupt shooters.

Projected starters: G Jon Elmore, 6-3, Jr. (22.8 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 6.9 apg, 82.8 FT%); G C.J. Burks, 6-4, Jr. (20.5 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 3.1 apg, 89.3 FT%); G Jarrod West, 5-11, Fr. (7.9 ppg, 2.9 apg, 41.5 3FG%); F Ajdin Penava, 6-9, Jr. (15.5 ppg, 8.6 rpg, 4.1 bpg, 55.3 FG%); F Jannson Williams, 6-9, Fr. (5.4 ppg, 3.3 rpg).

14. Stephen F. Austin

Nickname: Lumberjacks. Location: Nacogdoches, Texas.

Record: 28-6, 14-4. Bid: Southland champ.

Last appearance: 2016, lost to Notre Dame in Round of 32.

Coach: Kyle Keller (first appearance).

Overview: Stephen F. Austin was second in the conference in points a game (81.7) and in scoring defense (68.4 ppg). The Lumberjacks, who have been known to bust a bracket or two, are led by junior guard Shannon Bogues (16.0 ppg), sophomore swingman Kevon Harris (14.6) and junior forward T.J. Holyfield (12.9).

Projected starters: G Ty Charles, 6-5, Sr. (8 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 1.63 apg), G Ivan Canete, 6-4, Sr. (9.4 ppg, 3 apg) G/F Kevon Harris, 6-6, So. (14.8 ppg, 5.5 apg), F T.J. Holyfield, 6-8, Jr. (12.9 ppg, 6.3 rpg), F Leon Gilmore III, 6-7, Sr. (9.4 ppg, 5 rpg).

15. Cal State Fullerton

Nickname: Titans. Location: Fullerton.

Record: 20-11, 10-6. Bid: Big West champ.

Last appearance: 2008, lost to Wisconsin in Round of 64.

Coach: Dedrique Taylor (first appearance).

Overview: Cal State Fullerton is efficient on both ends, shooting 47% and holding opponents to 41.7%. But the Titans do not shoot the three a lot or well (33.8%) and they don’t take care of the ball, averaging more 14 turnovers a game.

Projected starters: G Kyle Allman, 6-3, Jr. (19.2 ppg, 3.3 rpg); G Khalil Ahmad, 6-4, Jr. (15.1 ppg, 3.8 rpg); F Jackson Rowe, 6-7, So. (12.4 ppg, 6.9 rpg, 58.7 FG%); G Austen Awosika, 6-3, So. (7.5 ppg, 3.8 rpg); F Arkim Robertson, 6-9, Sr. (5.4 ppg, 4.2 rpg).

16. LIU Brooklyn

Nickname: Blackbirds. Location: Brooklyn, N.Y.

Record: 18-16, 10-8. Bid: Northeast champ.

Last appearance: 2013, lost to James Madison in First Four.

Coach: Derek Kellogg (0-1 in one appearance).

Overview: The Blackbirds made an improbable run to the Northeast tournament title in Kellogg’s first season, capped by a win at No. 1 seed Wagner. Now they bring the momentum of a five-game win streak to their first appearance in five seasons. To keep things going, Joel Hernandez and Raiquan Clark will have to carry the scoring load. A lack of size could be a concern with just one regular taller than 6-6.

Projected starters: G Joel Hernandez, 6-3, Sr. (20.9 ppg, 5.9 rpg, 2.6 apg); G/F Raiquan Clark, 6-6, Jr. (17.4 ppg, 7.1 rpg, 55.6 FG%); G Jashaun Agosto, 5-11, So. (11.7 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 4.1 apg); G Julian Batts, 5-11, So. (10.0 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 40.9 3FG%); F/G Julius van Sauers, 6-8, So. (2.0 ppg, 2.2 rpg).

16. Radford

Nickname: Highlanders. Location: Radford, Va.

Record: 22-12, 12-6. Bid: Big South champ.

Last appearance: 2009, lost to North Carolina in Round of 64.

Coach: Mike Jones (first appearance).

Overview: Radford, picked to finish seventh in the Big South, overachieved. The Highlanders have won seven in a row, including the conference tournament title game against Liberty with a stunning three at the buzzer by Carlik Jones. Radford plays at a deliberate pace and thus doesn’t fill up the stats sheet or light up the scoreboard. The good news is the Highlanders don’t give up a lot of points (64.4 ppg, 16th in the nation). They will need to be efficient and shoot better than their averages (42.6%, 35% from three) to advance. Buzzer-beating threes certainly would help.

Projected starters: G Christian Bradford, 6-1, Sr. (4.2 ppg, 78.6 FT%); G Carlik Jones, 6-0, Fr. (11.8 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 3.0 apg); G Donald Hicks, 6-3, So. (7.8 ppg, 3.4 rpg, 40.3 3FG%); F Ed Polite Jr., 6-5, Jr. (13.5 ppg, 7.7 rpg, 48.5 FG%); C Randy Phillips, 6-8, Sr. (6.9 ppg, 5.7 rpg, 55.2 FG%).

Sony made a projector helmet to help you understand mosquitoes
Every year at SXSW in Austin, TX, Sony shows off a bunch of experimental projects. This year, the company introduced its Superception Head Light system, which is basically a helmet with a Sony MP-CL1 projector sticking out the front and attached Sony MDR-XB950 headphones on the side. Someone at Sony just strapped a bunch of devices together and attached a HTC Vive tracker to the back so that wearers can move around the room while the projection follows their movements.

Sony says the device is supposed to demonstrate how technology can affect human perception through our various senses. This demo attempts to teach wearers about how animals use their senses to get around the world — like how mosquitos use smell to find blood. The headphones played buzzing sounds while the projector attempted to show what the world would look like to a mosquito, with its smell alerts occasionally going off. It didn’t make much sense. Another demo showed the world through the eyes of a butterfly as the projector broadcasted a colorful, abstract mosaic onto the walls. I didn’t understand what I was supposed to take away from the experience, though I imagine it would have been more fun on drugs.

However! I will say thank you to Sony because I love Frankenstein gadgets like this one, even if the ultimate use case isn’t clear. You can walk around your house and play Netflix everywhere you go? Sony’s projector helmet is ultimately a technology in search of a problem. But plenty of gadgets would benefit from being a little more weird.

How your 401(k) stocks harness the power of invention
CLOSE So what’s a bull market anyway? It’s when the stock market rises 20 percent from a prior low. Despite some recent scares in the market, Wall Street will celebrate the bull market’s ninth birthday Friday. Josmar Taveras

From printing press and steam engine to cars, phones and computers, countless inventions transformed human life and our economy.

It’s unfathomable how different life would be without them. Imagine a world without oil refining, light bulbs, assembly lines, indoor plumbing or adhesive bandages. Few people fathom that since capitalism started, you can’t find a year without great inventions. Sometimes widespread adoption takes time, but creativity keeps conceiving the unfathomable.

In my lifetime alone, it’s unbelievable. Consider everything spawned from the integrated circuit and laser! Personal computers, video games, smartphones, Kindles and 3D printing. Or GPS, which will soon allow mass-marketed driverless cars.

From health care came endless vaccines, the pill and heart valve replacements —enabled by the heart-lung machine. Advanced treatments for cancer last year. HIV and hepatitis meds have prolonged millions of lives.

We also revolutionized life’s start with in-vitro fertilization — how four of my five grandkids were conceived. And caring for babies became far simpler thanks to disposable diapers.

If modern medicine hasn’t yet saved your life, perhaps the three-point seat belt has. The Department of Transportation estimates it saves 15,000 lives annually.

Search online, and you can’t find a year without major new inventions. Try: www.edinformatics.com/inventions_inventors if you’re skeptical. Market deployment of innovations is often delayed by the economy’s ups and downs. Or by regulations. But arrive they do. Creative thinkers are hard at work on futuristic fancies like healthier, synthetic — and hangover-free — booze, or electric clothes that vary temperature to fit changing weather and your needs, or sensors to catch potential tooth cavities. How about non-water, non-chemical electronic fire-extinguishers? Blood tests to presage depression? Some of these won’t “make it.” But many — and others currently unimaginable — will.

Innovators are getting ever younger. Hence Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos. The flow won’t stop, likely ever in your lifetime. Breakthroughs will continue as people keep solving new problems. Life will improve.

Existing things may become less valuable. Some will become as worthless as buggy whips or the cracked flower pot on your porch. Homes, as I’ve discussed before, only gain value from inflation or if GDP growth and household formation outruns home building.

Only true antiques, like a Model T, become more valuable just sitting there, through increased scarcity. Or rare art, like a Monet, Van Gogh or Picasso.

But business flourishes, generating real growth, because of the cumulative compound effect of these innovations. Look at Google and Apple today. Microsoft before them.

This doesn’t just mean we get more and better things. Quality of life also improves. And our wealth. Not just for the 1%!

Stocks let regular folks share in the creators’ wealth. Human creativity channeled through capitalism is what stocks are all about. It’s why economies grow above inflation and why stocks have beaten all other similarly liquid assets cumulatively since capitalism began.

It’s also why buying stocks in your 401(k) when you’re young, and holding them for the long term, is your best investment. It lets these inventions transfer wealth to you. You can enjoy the better life they bring soon — and the wealth they generate, too.

What could be better?

8 things to know about Trump's relationship with California

PALM SPRINGS, Calif. — On Tuesday, President Trump will make his way to California, the first time he's visited the state since taking office more than a year ago.

Not since Dwight Eisenhower has a president failed to visit California before the end of his first year in office.

It makes sense, though, considering Trump doesn't seem to like some of the state's leaders and he vehemently objects to how California handles those who have immigrated to America illegally.

He has vowed to punish California for granting "sanctuary" status to illegal immigrants. And, just last week, he lashed out at the mayor of Oakland, calling her a "disgrace" for warning families before federal immigration agents raided their homes and places of employment.

Despite his negative feelings about California, Trump seems to be positive about inspecting the prototypes for his proposed border wall. He'll do that in San Diego, before heading north to Los Angeles.

There he'll attend a swanky Republican fundraiser in Beverly Hills. Tickets start at $35,000 and top out at $250,000, Los Angeles Times reports.

Since this trip a big deal for the president, the state and its citizens, here's a look at Trump's history with California:

1. This trip could be Stormy

When Trump touches down in California, he'll still be dealing with accusations of an affair with porn star Stormy Daniels.

Recently, Daniels (real name: Stephanie Clifford) filed a civil lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court contending that a non-disclosure agreement connected to an alleged 2006-07 affair she had with Trump is not binding because Trump did not sign it.

President Trump's longtime lawyer said Friday he used his home-equity line of credit to arrange a $130,000 payment to Daniels.

"The funds were taken from my home-equity line and transferred internally to my LLC account in the same bank," Michael Cohen told ABC News, as scrutiny intensified over the October 2016 deal.

In a statement earlier this year, Cohen said that neither the Trump campaign nor the Trump Organization was party to the agreement to pay off Daniels or reimbursed him for the payment. His statement was silent on whether Trump personally reimbursed him.

Before Daniels filed her recent lawsuit, the president had won a temporary restraining order against her. Nevertheless, Daniels sued Trump, while her attorney publicly claimed Daniels indeed had a sexual relationship with the president.

2. Beverly Hills went red

Despite his clash of ideas with liberal-minded Hollywood, Trump managed to win the vote against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in one Beverly Hills district, according to the Times. While the rest of Los Angeles' west side went decidedly blue, voters in the neighborhood surrounding the Beverly Hills Hotel — one of Trump's favorite hangouts — voted 54% in favor of the New York businessman.

3. Show him the money

While campaigning to become the president, Trump raised $2.9 million in Los Angeles, according to OpenSecrets.org. In Century City, the city adjacent to Beverly Hills, Trump's campaign brought in $400,000.

4. A course, of course

The Trump Organization operates a golf course in Southern California formerly known as the Ocean Trails Golf Club. After Ocean Trails lost half its 18th hole to a landslide into the Pacific Ocean and had other problems, Trump bought the luxury course in 2002, renaming it Trump National Golf Club — Los Angeles, the Times reported. The course on the Palos Verdes Peninsula is known for its spectacular views of the Pacific and glimpses of Catalina Island on clear days.

According to WorldGolf.com, "Trump National Golf Club — Los Angeles is the most expensive golf course ever built at $264 million. The 'Donald Trump signature' layout features white sand bunkers, expansive lakes, lavish waterfalls and awesome views of the Pacific Ocean."

5. Maples at Melvyn's

During a visit to the Coachella Valley in 1991, Trump ate dinner by candlelight with his then-fiancee, Marla Maples, at Melvyn's Restaurant in Palm Springs. One host remembers Trump acting differently than his larger-than-life persona of today. "He wasn't pretentious or demanding. He didn't push his weight around," he said. Two years later, Trump was back in the valley to participate in the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.

6. Prefers room service?

While Trump may not want to hang out in the Palm Springs area — unlike his predecessor Barack Obama did multiple times during his presidency — Trump doesn't seem to mind Beverly Hills. He owns a 5,395-square-foot mansion across from the Beverly Hills Hotel but has told magazines he prefers to stay at the hotel when visiting California.

7. Not feeling the windmills

Trump even dislikes California's infrastructure. Back in 2016, when Trump was running for president, he went on Herman Cain's radio show and declared that the windmills along Interstate 10 near Palm Springs were "the worst thing you've ever seen." He once described the windmills as "rusting and rotting" and said they made Palm Springs look like a "junkyard."

8. Another casino goes bust

Trump had a big plan for a casino in the city of Coachella. In 2001, Trump wanted to invest in Spotlight 29, a bingo parlor run by the Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Mission Indians, a tribe of only 12 people. Spotlight 29 was the smallest casino in the Coachella Valley at the time, but Trump saw the potential for big money. Trump had the reputation and name to raise money for the casino. He became the casino's manager and Spotlight 29 became Trump 29 in 2002. But three years later, his multibillion-dollar resort company went bankrupt and his contract was later terminated for $6 million, less than the contract had earned him in a single year.

Best gaming keyboard 2018: the best gaming keyboards we've tested
If you have one of the best gaming PCs, packed with the best graphics card you could muster, the only thing you really need to complete your gaming experience is one of the best gaming keyboards. Trust us, we know that after dropping stacks on a high-end rig, it’s extremely tempting to just pick up a cheap keyboard, but after putting so much time, love, and money into your rig, you should pick something of comparable quality. This is because, more than any other PC component, the best gaming keyboards will go a long way to making you better at the games you play. Plus, there’s a certain je ne sais quoi about having your desk light up like a Christmas tree with RGB lighting.

Membrane keyboards are not great for gaming, to say the least. The best gaming keyboards feature mechanical switches that allow for deeper and more accurate travel, so you no longer have to worry about hitting a wrong button and killing a teammate. And, don’t forget about RGB lighting – at this point it’s an absolute must for all of your gaming equipment.

Which brings us to this list of the 10 best gaming keyboards you can buy in 2018. Even if you’re on a tight budget, you’ll find something to love here, because here at TechRadar, we strive to find products that strike a balance between price and performance with all of our buying guides. You should be confident that every MLG typewriter on this list will perform admirably while still being affordable.

1. Logitech G413 Carbon

Sleek, cheap and responsive

Interface: Wired | Keyboard backlighting: Yes | Programmable keys: No

Sophisticated, refined design

Full-on mechanical switches

No dedicated media buttons

Slow USB 2.0 pass through

This beautiful keyboard has been lovingly engineered for a lightning-fast actuation point of 1.5mm and this alone makes the Logitech G413 Carbon a force of nature. This mechanical power-house is defined by its extremely affordable price tag in addition to its use of Logitech’s Romer G switches, which have time and time again proven to be all but equal contenders to the switches made by Cherry. It also manages to keep a low profile, thanks to its stealthy frame and its nigh silent keys.

Read the full review: Logitech G413 Carbon

2. Razer BlackWidow Chroma V2

Steeled for online gaming

Interface: Wired | Keyboard backlighting: Yes | Programmable keys: 5

Great mechanical switch keys

Comfy wrist rest

Very pricey

Only one USB slot

Hoping to find a gaming keyboard that matches the rest of your Chroma-lit accessories? Then this is the one you want. Not only does the BlackWidow Chroma V2 carry an equal balance of comfort and performance, but it went a few steps further in the process. Complemented by the fact that Razer has tacked on five macro keys that can be assigned to virtually any in-game action, the BlackWidow Chroma V2 supports 16.8 million colors worth of LED lighting as well.

Read the full review: Razer BlackWidow Chroma V2

3. Corsair K63 Wireless

Wireless PC gaming at its finest

Interface: Wireless | Keyboard backlighting: Yes | Programmable keys: Yes

Perfect couch gaming

Fully featured

Flimsy palmrest clips

We have seen plenty of wireless gaming mice over the last few years, but not many wireless gaming keyboards. Until now. The Corsair K63 Wireless keyboard takes what made the wired version of the K63, and transfers it into the wireless version – without sacrificing much at all. Packing tight Cherry MX Red switches, full RGB lighting and convenient media controls, the K63 wireless shows us what wireless keyboards can be capable of in 2018.

Read the full review: Corsair K63 Wireless

4. HyperX Alloy Elite

A Cherry MX-powered circus of value

Interface: Wired | Keyboard backlighting: Yes | Programmable keys: No

Reasonably priced and fully featured

Handy media keys

Seriously thick cable

No macro programming

Following in the footsteps of Kingston’s first HyperX-branded gaming keyboard, namely the HyperX Alloy FPS, the HyperX Alloy Elite tweaks the company’s first winning keyboard to provide only a few subtle changes. For only $10 USD more than its predecessor, you’re getting media keys, a light bar and even a palm rest, all of which were previously absent. They’re also a series of delightful treats, making for a value proposition that shouldn’t be ignored.

Read the full review: HyperX Alloy Elite

5. Corsair K95 RGB Platinum

This mechanical animal has cheetah-like speeds

Interface: Wired | Keyboard backlighting: Yes | Programmable keys: Yes

Hypnotic disco lighting

Classy aluminum build

Awkward software

Rubber palm rest gets grungy quickly

Like the Corsair K70 Rapidfire before it, the K95 RGB Platinum is a gaming-first mechanical keyboard with plenty of versatility to get the job done, whatever that job may be. It even packs in 8MB of memory dedicated to storing the profiles of its six macro keys. This keyboard is not only backlit by up to 16.8 million colors, but it’s the perfect travel buddy too, made better by its military-grade aluminum finish, including the wrist rest.

Read the full review: Corsair K95 RGB Platinum

6. Razer Cynosa Chroma

A keyboard you can get wet

Interface: Wired | Keyboard backlighting: Yes | Programmable keys: Yes

Affordable

Low-profile build

Membrane switches

If you’re new to PC gaming, and you want a keyboard that’ll perform admirably without the high price tag that a lot of mechanical keyboards carry, the Razer Cynosa Chroma might be for you. It might not have the tactile clickiness of a higher-end board, but the hybrid mesh switches perform well enough, boasting a 1ms polling rate and 10-key rollover. That’s not to mention the sick RGB lighting.

Read the full review: Razer Cynosa Chroma

7. G.Skill Ripjaws KM570

Cherry MX switches at a bargain

Interface: Wired | Keyboard backlighting: Yes | Programmable keys: Yes

High quality Cherry MX switches

Stiff, solid design

No USB pass-through

One of the largest drawbacks to most gaming keyboards is that they look like, well, gaming keyboards. Not everyone wants an gigantic block of plastic with edgy font dominating their desk. Luckily, the G.Skill Ripjaws KM570 alleviates that issue altogether, while still boasting fantastic Cherry MX Brown switches and fully customizable RGB lighting. It might be missing some features from more high-end keyboards, but it’s also a lot more affordable.

Read the full review: G.Skill Ripjaws KM570

8. Creative Sound BlasterX Vanguard K08

A fantastic first keyboard from an unlikely manufacturer

Interface: Wired | Keyboard backlighting: Yes | Programmable keys: Yes

Exotic lighting

Great switches

Tight spacing between keys

Creative has made a name for itself in the past by manufacturing sound cards and other audio tech. But as that market continues to shrink, Creative has taken a cue from the Corsairs of the world and dipped their toes into the PC peripheral game. And honestly, the Creative Sound BlasterX Vanguard K08 is a fantastic first entry. Forgoing the traditional Cherry MX switches that many gaming keyboards rely on, the Vanguard K08 opts instead for custom Omron switches, and this is what sets this keyboard apart from the pack. These switches have a shorter actuation point than many competing gaming keyboards, while still maintaining the reliability of a mechanical switch. Theoretically, it should mean that with this keyboard, you’ll be able to perform actions in-game faster than your competition. And that might make this one of the best keyboards for competitive gamers.

Read the full review: Creative Sound BlasterX Vanguard K08

9. Razer Ornata

Combining mechanical and membrane into one

Interface: Wired | Keyboard backlighting: Full color | Programmable keys: No

Tactile and clicky actuation

Magnetic plush wrist rest

Short key throw won't jive with everyone

For too long there's been a divide between mechanical and membrane keys but now Razer has finally brought the two together with its 'Mecha-Membrane' Ornata keyboard. These new switches pull from everything Razer has learned over the years. The result is a grand typing experience with shorter keys, the tactile feel of the green switches from the Black Widow X Chroma and a loud audible click.

10. Cherry MX Board 6.0

An all-metal affair

Interface: Wired | Keyboard backlighting: Yes | Programmable keys: Yes

Excellent typing feel

Comfortable low profile

Lacks extra features

Lending it to fast response times, the Cherry MX Board 6.0 is defined by its Cherry MX Red switches, hence the make and model. However, because the keys are positioned fairly close together they're excellent for typing in addition to gaming. What’s more, housed in an eye-catching aluminum chassis, the MX Board 6.0 certainly doesn't feel cheap and its blood-red key lighting is deliciously ominous.

This product is only available in the US at the time of this writing. UK and Australian readers: check out a fine alternative in the HyperX Alloy Elite

The Seven Biggest NCAA Tournament 2018 Snubs




© Andy Lyons/Getty Images Louisville Yes, the Cardinals didn’t do much damage in their Quadrant 1 games, going 3-10 in those contests. They do deserve credit for wins at Florida State and Virginia Tech, however. Furthermore, it’s surprising to see the Selection Committee turn its back on a team ranked 38th in the RPI and 15th in strength of schedule, with zero bad losses. Every single defeat the Cardinals suffered came to a team in the tournament field. That’s typically more than enough for an at-large bid, but it wasn’t good enough for the Cardinals this season. They also ranked 33rd on kenpom.com, which should have worked in their favor. They will rue the day they let Virginia come back from four points down with six seconds left. Hold on to that one and the Cardinals almost certainly would have been in the field.

© Scott Winters/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images Oklahoma State's Jeffrey Carroll, right, celebrates with teammate Kendall Smith after a three-point basket late in the first half against Oklahoma in the Big 12 Tournament. Oklahoma State This is an interesting one. There’s some cognitive dissonance at work in granting Arizona State an at-large bid but snubbing the Cowboys. The Sun Devils got in largely on the strength of their big wins over Kansas and Xavier. Oklahoma State also beat Kansas—twice. In addition to that, they took down West Virginia (on the road), Texas Tech, Texas, Oklahoma twice and Florida State on a neutral floor. If Arizona State’s signature wins were enough to get them into the field, it would follow that Oklahoma State’s should have been, too. The problem for the Cowboys was their RPI, which came in at 88th on Selection Sunday. No team with an RPI that high has ever earned an at-large bid. The Cowboys made a strong run at history, but the committee deemed them unworthy of such an honor.

© Leon Bennett/Getty Images USC The Trojans also checked most of the boxes the committee asks of at-large teams. They finished 34th in the RPI, went 4-6 in Q1 games, won 23 total game and advanced to their conference championship. It’s not a gaudy résumé by any stretch of the imagination, but it has generally the right mix strengths the committee uses to make its team-by-team comparisons as apples-to-apples as possible. The Trojans had reason enough to feel confident heading into Selection Sunday, even after letting an automatic bid slip away in its loss to Arizona in the Pac-12 championship game. Ultimately, their total lack of wins against teams that earned at-large bids cost them a trip to the dance. While the Trojans do have legitimate reason to feel snubbed, it’s hard to argue with that logic. Their four Q1 wins were against Middle Tennessee State, New Mexico State, Utah and Oregon, and they lost games to Princeton and SMU. Did they have a solid résumé? Yes. Is it a miscarriage of justice that they’re headed to the NIT? No.

© Ethan Miller/Getty Images Tanner Krebs of Saint Mary's brings the ball up the court during a quarterfinal game of the WCC tournament against Pepperdine. Saint Mary's The Gaels seemed like a safe tournament team for most of the season, but recent losses to San Francisco and BYU opened the door to the NIT. The committee forced the Gaels through that door, but was it justified? Kenpom.com rated them 28th in the country, while Sagarin had them at No. 42. They won at Gonzaga, one of the best individual wins for any team not in the field of 68. At the same time, their strength of schedule ranked 194th and the only reason they picked up a second Q1 win was because BYU jumped up by virtue of beating the Gaels in the WCC semifinals. Like USC, there were strong arguments for and against Saint Mary’s. The committee sided with the ones in the latter camp.

© Richard C. Lewis/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images Middle Tennessee forward Brandon Walters rebounds during a Jan. 4 game against Florida International in Miami. Middle Tennessee State This was easy to see coming, even though the Blue Raiders have a strong snub case. The Selection Committee simply hasn’t shown much appetite in recent years for similar teams—such as Monmouth two years ago and Illinois State last year—and it didn’t change course this season. There was a lot to like about this Middle Tennessee team. They finished the season 33rd in RPI with a pair of Q1 victories. Their non-conference strength of schedule ranked 11th in the country, and that had to impress the committee. Still, it could not get over the fact that the Blue Raiders had zero wins against at-large quality teams, compounded by four losses to teams nowhere near the at-large field, including a Southern Miss team ranked 207th in RPI. Until the committee signals that it has changed standard operating procedure, we should always assume that teams like this are going to get the short end of the stick, fair or not.

© Kathy Willens/AP Photo Marquette players, including guard Andrew Rowsey, center, with towel over his head, watch the waning minutes of the team's loss to Villanova in the Big East tournament quarterfinals. Marquette The Golden Eagles can score with the best in the country and that would have made them an interesting tourney team. They own three Q1 victories—over Providence, Seton Hall and Creighton, all on the road—and five total wins over teams that got at-large bids. Nothing else about their résumé jumps off the page, from their average standing in traditional metrics like RPI (57th) to their similarly average computer rankings (53rd on kenpom.com, 51st in Sagarin). If the Golden Eagles can point to one misstep that cost them, it was a late February loss to DePaul, their only reversal against a team worse than 77th in the RPI.

O.J. Simpson reveals 'hypothetical' murder details in 2006 Fox interview
CLOSE 'O.J. Simpson: The Lost Confession' Executive Producer Terence Wrong discusses the recently found 2006 interview that will air on Fox Sunday night (March 9) AP

'O.J. Simpson: The Lost Confession,' a 2006 interview with the accused but not convicted murderer, airs tonight on Fox. (Photo: Fox)

In an interview that has been under wraps for 12 years, O.J. Simpson offered a "hypothetical" explanation for the 1994 murders of ex-wife Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman.

Fox aired a two-hour special, O.J. Simpson: The Lost Confession?, in which an interview Simpson did in 2006 with publisher Judith Regan was repackaged and broadcast for the first time Sunday night.

"This is one story the whole world got wrong," Simpson says in the intro.

The program begins with Simpson discussing the history of physical altercations he had with his ex-wife. According to prosecuting attorney Christopher Darden, police had been to their house "multiple times" to respond to domestic disputes.

"Nicole left for us the diary, notes, photographs. She documented the abuse," Darden says in a panel discussion in between segments of the Simpson interview. "My sense is that she knew she was going to die and she wanted to make sure we knew who killed her."

After one particular incident in 1989, Simpson was convicted of spousal abuse after beating Brown so severely that she required hospital treatment.

"The one thing that hurts me as much as anything in this — aside from being considered a murderer — is being a batterer," Simpson says. "Somehow, I came out of all of that because of that night as the poster boy of an abuser."

June 12, 1994

Both O.J. and Nicole Simpson attended a recital for one of their daughters, but afterward he wasn't invited to a group dinner at the Mezzaluna restaurant where waiter Ron Goldman worked.

Simpson, who never took the stand at his criminal trial and has never given an interview about his actions on the night of the murders, describes what happened next -- but only in a "hypothetical" sense.

("He felt if he could claim 'hypothetical' at this point, he would have deniability with the children," Regan says on the panel discussion.)

Simpson says he and a friend named Charlie - who he had known for a few weeks - went to Nicole's house later that evening.

"In the hypothetical, I put on a cap and gloves," he says. He gets a knife from under the seat of his car. "I always kept a knife in that car for the crazies and stuff because you can't travel with a gun."

While Simpson was there, Goldman arrived to return a pair of glasses left at the restaurant. The two men argued and Nicole came out of the house because of the commotion. He says Nicole fell and hurt herself.

"At that time, I think Charlie had followed this guy in, to make sure there was no problem, and he brought in the knife," Simpson says.

Moments later, "this guy kind of got into a karate thing, and I said, 'Well, you think you can kick my (expletive)?' " Simpson continues. "I took the knife from Charlie, and to be honest, after that, I don't remember, except I'm standing there and there's all kinda stuff around. Blood and stuff.

"I didn't think any two people could be murdered the way they were without everybody covered in blood. We've all seen the grisly pictures after. Everything was covered in blood."

("I think he's confessed to murder," Darden says during a break in the interview. "I don't think there's any question that he's the person who's wielding the knife. ... This is no hypothetical. This is reality.")

Simpson admits he took off his shoes, pants and shirt and put them in a bundle. "Somebody had to get rid of the bloody clothes," he says.

After leaving Los Angeles for a business trip to Chicago, Simpson returned to a media circus and was questioned by police.

The hardest part?

"It seemed so easy listening to TV that week that it was that easy for people to believe that I could kill two people. I thought my whole life meant something," Simpson says. "It was hard for me to accept that people would believe that."

The Bronco chase

Once Simpson became a suspect and it came time to turn himself in to authorities, he was a no-show. But he left behind a note that addressed his relationship with Nicole: "If we had a problem, it's because I loved her so much."

In the interview, Simpson says he was considering suicide when he disappeared with his friend Al Cowlings in a white Ford Bronco.

TV helicopters found the vehicle and for more than two hours, Cowlings drove Simpson along the freeways around Los Angeles as police gave chase.

"I'm in the back of the truck and I can't believe what I'm seeing. Everytime we go by intersections ... where did these people get the time to make these signs? 'Go O.J.' and stuff," he says. "What was strange is I was being depicted as a fugitive on the radio, but on the sides of the road it was people cheering."

The verdict

Simpson was taken into custody and at the end of a memorable 11-month trial. Simpson was acquitted of double murder in 1995 in what widely was known as the "Trial of the Century."

"I felt that if there was anything right with the universe, there's no way they can convict me of this," he tells Regan. "And we're not talking hypothetical here. That's how I felt."

At the conclusion of the interview Simpson is asked how he thinks he will be remembered.

"Everybody is going to give their opinion. They're going to hypothesize what this book means," he says. "Whatever you want to take from it, I cannot control it. Whichever reason why I did it, you decide. You read it. You decide."

Epilogue

The original 2006 special, If I Did It, was a companion to Simpson's book of the same name, which Regan edited. When the victims' families balked that Simpson would have profited from its airing and several Fox stations and advertisers pulled out, the show was not run. Fox chief Rupert Murdoch later admitted it was "an ill-considered project."

About 45 minutes of the special were screened for media Thursday.

Simpson was convicted in civil court in 1997 and ordered to pay $33 million as part of a wrongful death suit.

Simpson, now 70, was convicted in 2008 on felony charges of armed robbery and kidnapping, but was granted parole and released from a Nevada prison on Oct. 1, 2017.

Sally Field for the win.

Because of the actress' masterful mom meddling, her son, filmmaker Sam Greisman, got to meet his crush, Adam Rippon.

Greisman shared with his 26,000-plus Twitter followers that he and the Olympic skater had crossed paths. And he knew exactly who deserved credit for the meeting.

"Thanks, mom," Greisman tweeted Saturday night, along with a photo of the two gents embracing.

Back in February, Greisman shared a screenshot of a conversation with his mother that he described as "some really helpful advice from my mom on how to deal with my Olympic crush." Though Greisman didn't identify the object of his affection, Field, who was clearly shipping the twosome, alerted Rippon to their convo by mentioning him on Twitter.

Rippon predicted the two would eventually meet in an interview with BuzzFeed in February. "Sam, your mom — I admire her. And I’m sure one day we’re going to meet. So thanks, mom."

3 things we learned from Galaxy S9 teardown
The Galaxy S9 is finally here, and it's time to take a look at what makes Samsung's new flagship handset tick.

The phone features a sexy dual-curved design and a terrific camera for well-lit shots. But low-light images often look blurry and lack the fine texture and contrast of competing phone cameras. So what gives?

Thankfully, our friend tech repair site iFixit has posted its extensive Galaxy S9 teardown, as it does for many a new gadget upon release. Here's what we just learned from Samsung's flagship laid bare.

iFixit

First let's get to that industry-first dual aperture lens that Samsung put in both Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus phones. While standard camera lenses use at least five aperture blades, the S9 uses just two rotating, ring-like blades for its single auto-adjust for low light, which might explain the sometimes blurry photos.

iFixit

The S9 sports 3D avatars and new face unlock tools meant to match similar features in the iPhone X, but they fall short of the mark. The reason may lie in the S9's biometric hardware. iFixit found the handset's iris scanner, front-facing camera, IR emitter and proximity sensor are "pretty much exactly" what was found in last year's Galaxy S8.

iFixit

The Galaxy S9 delivers strong battery life, but that's not so new either. In a bit of déjà vu, iFixit found the battery to be a 3.85V, 3500mAh unit weighing in at 13.48Wh. If that sounds familiar, it's because those are same specs of the battery found in the Galaxy S8 Plus last year. Also, iFixit found that while replacing the S9's battery is technically possible, accessing it's a bit of a challenge.

My CNET colleague Jessica Dolcourt calls the Samsung S9 a good upgrade from older Androids, but says S8 owners can skip it.

How to watch Wales v Italy: 6 Nations rugby live stream
How to watch Wales v Italy Today's game kicks off at 3pm, with live coverage on BBC One from 2.30pm, with viewers on the BBC Sport app and connected TVs also able to tune in, as well as visitors to the BBC website.

This weekend's 6 Nations rugby wraps up today as Wales take on Italy.

The hosts return to Cardiff after a chastening 37-27 loss to Ireland last time out that may well have put paid to their hopes of winning the tournament overall.

Warren Gatland has rung the changes from that side, making ten alterations to his starting line-up as Wales look to put in a strong performance in front of what will no doubt be an enthusiastic home crowd.

Among the changes are debuts for flanker James Davies and Elliot Dee, alongside returns for Taulupe Faletau, George North and Gareth Anscombe.

Italy are looking to avoid yet another 6 Nations defeat, and look to keep much of the same team as Conor O'Shea looks for consistency, although Tommaso Boni misses out with injury.

If you've not managed to get tickets for the big game, and can't get to a TV, here is TechRadar's guide to watching all the 6 Nations rugby action online, wherever you are in the world.
