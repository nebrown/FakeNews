London mayor Sadiq Khan tells tech giants they are not above the law
London mayor Sadiq Khan has told technology giants that they are not above the law and has demanded new regulations to rein the companies in if they fail to live up to expectations.

The Labour politician, who oversees a capital with 300,000 tech workers and thousands of start-ups as well as major bases for Apple, Facebook and Google, said governments have been “sitting on their hands” when it comes to regulation.

In a speech at South by Southwest, a technology festival in Texas, Mr Khan will on Monday raise concerns about the way social media and gig economy companies are “impacting our lives and the overall wellbeing of our societies”.

He said they need “prudent regulation and oversight” to prevent workers and consumers being forgotten by technology.

Mr Khan has few powers to regulate technology companies directly, but internet groups have been criticised for failing to prevent radicalisation following several terrorist attacks in the capital last year. Transport for London (TfL), which the mayor oversees, stripped Uber of its licence to operate in London last year. Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple have all outlined plans to open new offices and employ thousands of workers in London in the coming years.
