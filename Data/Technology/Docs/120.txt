SoftBank drafts US mobile network chief onto Arm board
Japanese technology giant SoftBank has drafted the boss of its US mobile network onto the board of British technology company Arm Holdings.

Marcelo Claure, the chief executive of US mobile network company Sprint, has joined the board of Arm, the Cambridge-based company that SoftBank bought for £24.3bn two years ago.

Mr Claure has run Sprint since 2014, two years after SoftBank acquired a majority stake. He also holds a seat on the board of Uber after SoftBank’s $9bn (£6.5bn) investment in the ride-hailing company in December last year.

The appointment of Mr Claure to Cambridge-headquartered Arm comes as Softbank considers London as a potential site for a listing of Softbank Corp, its mobile phone business. In January, the Sunday Telegraph reported Softbank had picked bankers Citi and Mizuho to lead on the float, expected to take place later this year.

While the Tokyo Stock Exchange is considered the most likely site of the float, a dual listing in London is also thought to be in the running for the anticipated $18bn listing.
