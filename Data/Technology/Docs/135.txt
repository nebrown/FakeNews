Uber seeking billion-dollar loan
Uber has confirmed that it is looking to secure a $1.25bn (£900m) leveraged loan, less than a month after revealing that its losses ballooned to $4.5bn last year.

The ride-hailing company is thought to be contacting loan investors directly over the financing, which was first reported by Bloomberg, with Uber expected to meet with investors on Friday.

By choosing to raise funds through debt rather than equity, this will mean Uber's existing shareholder base will not be diluted.

It comes just over a year and a half after Uber last tapped the leverage loan market, when it raised $1.15bn, with those funds having been used to help Uber expand globally, as well as invest further in research and development.

Last month, the company said its sales had increased 61pc in 2017, hitting $7.5bn, but its losses widened to $4.5bn from $2.8bn in 2016 due to heavy writedowns and legal expenses.

Uber does not have to report earnings, as it is not a publicly-listed company, but chooses to do so.

The search for loan investors is likely to attract a lot of interest, given Uber received a $48bn valuation late last year on an investment led by Softbank Group.

The move, which saw Softbank take a 15pc stake in Uber and become its largest shareholder, was seen to provide a much-needed boost to the ride-hailing firm, which has faced a series of road-bumps over the past year, including being stripped of its licence to operate in London.
