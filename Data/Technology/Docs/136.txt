Amazon trying to fix glitch causing Echo's Alexa to laugh spontaneously
Amazon said it was working to fix an issue with its Alexa-enabled devices causing them to spontaneously burst into laughter.

Amazon confirmed that it was aware of the problem on Wednesday night, in news first reported by The Verge, though did not provide further details of what was causing it or how long it would take to fix.

Its voice assistant Alexa is activated on Echo smart speakers through voice commands.

Users have been posting about the issue on social media for the past two days, with one claiming he asked Alexa to turn off the lights, but instead heard a woman laugh.

"Alexa but please don’t try to kill me in my sleep," another user said in a post on Twitter, after her Echo device began laughing unprompted.
