Bernie Sanders is at Dodgers camp offering hitting tips to Yasiel Puig
Do you want context or do you just want to dream on this one?

With a few tweaks I think @YasielPuig had 30 home runs in him this year. pic.twitter.com/sPqphKlOi3 — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) March 11, 2018

Vermont senator Bernie Sanders grew up in Brooklyn a huge Dodgers fan, and the club’s departure for Los Angeles helped shape his personal politics. Sanders participated in the 2005 Congressional hearing on steroids in baseball and seized the opportunity to speak out about healthcare and childhood poverty. He is visiting Dodgers camp on Sunday for reasons that are unclear beyond that it is fun to attend spring training and meet awesome baseball players.

Puig, a firebrand of a baseball man and apparently a game student of Bernie Sanders’ hitting philosophy, notched a career-high 28 homers in 2017.

Ideologically, the pair shares something in common: Sanders advocates for cutting out the middleman in healthcare, and Puig shows the benefits of cutting out the middleman on many of his throws from the outfield.
