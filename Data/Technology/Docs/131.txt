Billionaire Facebook board member Peter Thiel has access to Trump 'anytime'
One of Facebook's first major investors has revealed that he has a direct line to US President Donald Trump, a comment certain to stoke the controversy surrounding the social network and its political influence.

Peter Thiel, the billionaire Paypal co-founder and one of Facebook's founding board members , said that he has access to the US president "anytime I want," in a rare interview.

The 50-year-old is no stranger to controversy. Despite Facebook's ambition to appear agnostic and politically neutral, Thiel aggressively backed Mr Trump throughout his election campaign, even speaking at a Republican conference in 2016.

He has also made clear his plans to create a rightwing media company to rival Breitbart and Fox, publishers which some have argued do not align with Facebook's "mission" to build communities.

The network is facing its own issues regarding this mission and is currently conducting a review into how it became a vehicle for Russia to influence the US Presidential election by buying misleading advertisements and spreading divisive "fake news".
