How to watch March Madness online

This is the best way to watch March Madness online - from absolutely anywhere in the world - without any commercial breaks:

How to watch March Madness in the US

1. Watch online

Good news - if you are in the US, this will be fairly straightforward, as every single March Madness game will be broadcast on either TBS, TNT, TruTV or CBS, with the action kicking off at 6pm ET.

You can also stream every game on March Madness Live.

However if you don't have a US cable account, you'll need to seek an alternative solution - using an another content provider, alongside a VPN.

2. Go to TV.youtube.com

Several online US-based TV streaming services offer the above channels as part of their bundles and a few of them offer trials and the best one is YoutubeTV, an official Google product.

The service costs $35 a month, but you can also trial it for 30 days; the ability to record to the cloud and hold up to six accounts per household (and 3 simultaneous streams per membership) are its most alluring selling points. You can watch it on most devices and there are no fees for canceling.

However, you will need a US IP address in order to access all of the above and if you are outside the US, you will need to get an IP address located there by using a VPN.

How to watch March Madness in the UK

If you’re outside the US, it may be a bit trickier to get a stream of the March Madness action, but it is possible using Sling TV, a VPN and a PayPal account.

Sling TV is another subscription-based service which offers live and on-demand programming - including March Madness. Although typically geoblocked outside of the US, Sling TV can be unlocked using a VPN - more on that below.

Once you have set up your account (which can be a 7-day free trial) and established your Sling TV account using a VPN, you will be able to watch March Madness in its entirety.

1.
