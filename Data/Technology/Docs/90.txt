Lin Xiwei, a 36-years-old shoemaker from Putian, dressed as a local deity, performs the "eating flowers" ritual in Xiaohu, Baitang, in China's Fujian province, on March 8, 2018. Working themselves into a trance, bare-chested men in eastern China lean into incandescent fountains of sparks to cleanse themselves of evil spirits and ensure a fortuitous new year. The spectacular scene takes place annually in villages such as Xiaohu in coastal Fujian province, which is home to an array of colorful centuries-old Lunar New Year rites linked to ancient customs and local gods.
