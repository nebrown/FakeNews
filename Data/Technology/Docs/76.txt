“What is important now is to make everything clear,” Suga said at a news conference.

He did not directly respond to a question about media reports that the name of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s wife, Akie, had been removed from documents related to the sale, which the government admitted on Monday had been altered.

The finance ministry plans to submit all findings available at the moment on its investigation into the case to parliament on Monday afternoon, Suga said.
