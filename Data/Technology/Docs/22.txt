Samsung made real waves with its new flagship phone at MWC 2018. There's so much to love when it comes to the Galaxy S9. From performance to design, let's take a look at some of its new features.

Let's start with the battery. The S9 has a full day's worth of battery life and if that's not enough, it can recharge really quickly: Charging from empty to full takes less than 2 hours. The S9 has a few key design upgrades from the S8, with a new finger-scanner position and brighter screen. Plus it's available in new colors: blue and purple.

The S9 has some hot new features as well, including super-slow-motion video recording and AR Emoji (similarly to Apple's animojis). You can read CNET's full Galaxy S9 review here.
