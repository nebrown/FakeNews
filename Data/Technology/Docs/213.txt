Stranger Things creators Matt and Ross Duffer are responding to allegations that the set of their series is an abusive environment.

The brothers at the helm of the Netflix show apologized for an occasionally tense atmosphere in a joint statement issued Sunday to USA TODAY.

“We are deeply upset to learn that someone felt uncomfortable on our set,” the statement says. “Due to the high-stress nature of production, tempers occasionally get frayed, and for that, we apologize. However, we think it is important not to mischaracterize our set, where we believe strongly in treating everyone fairly regardless of gender, orientation, race, religion, or anything else. We remain totally committed to providing a safe and collaborative working environment for everyone on our productions.”

The statement comes after allegations of verbal abuse posted March 8 via an unverified Instagram account, @peytonnbrown, described in her bio as a "lady grip." H. Peyton Brown is credited with working on nine episodes of the series as a grip on IMDb. She says she will not take part in filming the show's third season.

"I personally witnessed two men in high positions of power on that set seek out and verbally abuse multiple women," Brown says. "I promised myself that if I were ever in a situation to say something that I would. I have 11.5 thousand followers who can hear me say this, TIME IS UP.

"Women in the film industry are POWERFUL," writes Brown, who has now amassed more than 14,000 followers. "We will rise and we will scream from mountain tops in support of each other and I will not contribute my time, efforts, and talent to such abusive people."

According to screenshots from Entertainment Tonight, Brown confirmed in comments (since turned off) she was talking about the Duffers. She also alleges "there was yelling, there were insults, there were threats and people were even fired or forced to quit because of them."

Netflix told USA TODAY that an investigation by the streaming service did not support the claims. "We looked into the concern that was raised when we heard of the allegation on Thursday, and found no wrongdoing," the service's statement says. "Maintaining a safe, respectful atmosphere on set is important to us, and we know it is to the Duffer Brothers as well.”
