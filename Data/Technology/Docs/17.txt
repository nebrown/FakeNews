Kirk or Picard? Amazon's Jeff Bezos makes his choice
Kirk or Picard? Star Trek fans can argue endlessly for the swashbuckling sexiness of William Shatner's James T. Kirk or the intellectual charm of Patrick Stewart's Jean-Luc Picard, but Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has made his choice.

In a tweet sent out Saturday, billionaire Bezos shared a photo of himself and his wife, MacKenzie Bezos, posing on the red carpet at last week's Oscars. And who's that Star Trek captain with him? Hint: Reports of his assimilation are greatly exaggerated.

Yep, it's Patrick Stewart of Picard fame, and his wife, Sunny Ozell. You might spot a resemblance between the two tall bald dudes. In a response to Bezos' hashtag of #GoBoldly, one Twitter user was quick to joke: "And #GoBaldly."

Kirk fans shouldn't feel bad, Bezos has shown his love for their (rebooted) captain as well, playing an alien in a brief cameo in 2016's 'Star Trek Beyond," which features Chris Pine as young Kirk.
