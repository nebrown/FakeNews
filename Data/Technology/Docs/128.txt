Samsung Galaxy S9: Release date, specs, colours, price and all you need to know
Samsung has revealed its latest flagship smartphone: the Samsung Galaxy S9. The new phone follows its highly successful Galaxy S8 and could set the bar for Android smartphones for the year to come.

The new phone features Samsung's now ubiquitous edge-to-edge display, AR emoji, a powerful camera and stylish super-slow motion video. Samsung has said the smartphone will "reinvent the camera", putting high-spec camera technology front and centre of the new handset.

The Samsung Galaxy S9 will lay down a challenge to Apple's premium iPhone X. It is slightly cheaper at £739, but comes with plenty of premium specs to make it a major rival to the current Apple line up.
