Best Round of 64 matchup: The 8-9 pairing is usually a solid choice, and the Virginia Tech-Alabama clash shouldn’t disappoint. Collin Sexton can be one of the most dynamic players in the country when healthy, and he has been down the stretch. The Hokies have figured some things out as the season has progressed, most notably how to defense the interior.

BIGGEST SNUBS: Seven teams that had strong case to make NCAA field

BRACKET ANALYSIS: Selection committee valued early wins, not late failures

Potential upset: Stephen F. Austin is under new management but is still a known giant killer. Texas Tech struggled with injuries in February, most notably to top playmaker Keenan Evans. Though the Red Raiders looked healthier in the Big 12 tournament, they might still be vulnerable. If the Lumberjacks are at all close, they’ll likely pick up support from the home-state crowd in Dallas.

The sleeper: West Virginia will have its hands full just getting out of its opening tilt with a strong Murray State squad, not to mention a potential round-of-32 clash with Wichita State. But if the Mountaineers advance far enough to earn a Sweet 16 date with Villanova, they might just be the kind of team that can pose problems for the Wildcats with their pressing defense. Whether WVU could make enough shots to keep up would be the biggest question, but the matchup could have the potential to ruin a few brackets.

The winner: With that in mind, however, the top-seeded Wildcats appear to have regained the form that had them atop the polls for much of the season. Look for Villanova to erase the memory of last year’s disappointing second-round exit and make it back to the Final Four. They are going for their second national championship in three years.

The teams

1. Villanova

Nickname: Wildcats. Location: Villanova, Pa.

Record: 30-4, 14-4. Bid: Big East champ.

Last appearance: 2017, lost to Wisconsin in round of 32.

Coach: Jay Wright (21-13 in 14 appearances).

Overview: It’s been feast or famine for the Wildcats recently in the tournament, either going all the way or flaming out early. The fate of this year’s group will hinge on its biggest strength. Quite simply, they can shoot the lights out, better than 50% overall and almost 40% from the arc. They also convert at a 77% clip from the free-throw line. The problem: Defense can be suspect when shots aren’t falling.

Projected starters: G Jalen Brunson, 6-3, Jr. (19.4 ppg, 3.1 rpg, 4.7 apg, 53.1 FG%, 41.3 3FG%); G Mikal Bridges, 6-6, Jr. (18.0 ppg, 5.4 rpg, 52.1 FG%, 43.3 FG%); G Phil Booth, 6-3, Jr. (10.9 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 2.8 apg); F Omari Spellman, 6-9, Fr. (10.7 ppg, 7.9 rpg); F Eric Paschall, 6-9, Jr. (10.3 ppg, 5.1 rpg).

2. Purdue

Nickname: Boilermakers. Location: West Lafayette, Ind.

Record: 28-6, 15-3. Bid: Big Ten at-large.

Last appearance: 2017, lost to Kansas in Sweet 16.

Coach: Matt Painter (11-10 in 10 appearances).

Overview: The Boilermakers won 19 in a row and looked like the Big Ten’s best before a three-game skid in early February. They responded by winning six in a row before falling to red-hot Michigan in the Big Ten tournament final. Sophomore Carsen Edwards has emerged as an All-American, giving Purdue the alpha dog scorer it needs for a deep March run. The Boilermakers rank second nationally in three-point field goal percentage (42%).

Projected starters: G P.J. Thompson, 5-10, Sr. (7.1 ppg, 85.2 FT%); G Dakota Mathias, 6-4, Sr. (12.4 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 4.1 apg, 46.4 3FG%); G Carsen Edwards, 6-1, So. (18.5 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 41.2 3FG%); F Vincent Edwards, 6-8, Sr. (14.9 ppg, 7.3 rpg, 83.8 FT%); C Isaac Haas, 7-2, Sr., (14.9 ppg, 5.6 rpg, 62.1 FG%).

3. Texas Tech

Nickname: Red Raiders. Location: Lubbock.

Record: 24-9, 11-7. Bid: Big 12 at-large.

Last appearance: 2016, lost to Butler in Round of 64.

Coach: Chris Beard (1-1 in one appearance).

Overview: For a stretch in February, Texas Tech — a defense-first, veteran bunch — looked like the team to unlock Kansas’ Big 12 supremacy. Then when senior guard Keenan Evans hurt a toe; the Red Raiders lost four in a row, falling out of the Big 12 race and dropping a couple of seed lines, too. But if Evans is healthy, Texas Tech could make a run.

Projected starters: G Keenan Evans, 6-3, Sr. (17.5 ppg, 3.1 rpg, 3.2 apg, 80.9 FT%); G Zhaire Smith, 6-5, Fr. (11.2 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 41.9 3FG%); G Justin Gray, 6-6, Sr. (5.0 ppg, 3.4 rpg, 83.7 FT%); G Jarrett Culver, 6-5, Fr. (11.7 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 40.8 3FG%); C Norense Odiase, 6-9, Jr. (4.1 ppg, 4.7 rpg).

4. Wichita State

Nickname: Shockers. Location: Wichita.

Record: 25-7, 14-4. Bid: American at-large.

Last appearance: 2017, lost to Kentucky in Round of 32.

Coach: Gregg Marshall (11-13 in 13 appearances).

Overview: The Shockers’ first trip through their new league wasn’t always smooth. But the more challenging slate ultimately could serve them well, which was the reason for the change. As is the signature of Marshall’s teams, the Shockers aren’t afraid to dive on the floor after loose balls. But this group actually is more successful in a more free-flowing game when it can space the court and find open shooters.

Projected starters: G Landry Shamet, 6-4, So. (15.0 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 5.1 apg); G Conner Frankamp, 6-1, Sr. (10.1 ppg, 2.3 apg); C Shaquille Morris, 6-8, Sr. (14.0 ppg, 5.5 rpg); F Rashard Kelly, 6-7, Sr. (5.7 ppg, 7.5 rpg); F Zach Brown, 6-6, Sr. (4.7 ppg, 3.1 rpg).

5. West Virginia

Nickname: Mountaineers. Location: Morgantown.

Record: 24-20, 11-7. Bid: Big 12 at-large.

Last appearance: 2017, lost to Gonzaga in Sweet 16.

Coach: Bob Huggins (31-23 in 23 appearances).

Overview: West Virginia lives and dies with defense. Led by senior guard Jevon Carter, Big 12 defensive player of the year for the second season in a row, the Mountaineers’ smothering pressure is the key — especially because their offense has been frighteningly inconsistent. It might be this simple: How is the officiating? West Virginia can swarm and overwhelm opponents but can rack up fouls in a tightly called game.

Projected starters: G Jevon Carter, 6-2, Sr. (17.0 ppg, 4.8 rpg); G Daxter Miles Jr., 6-3, Sr. (12.7 ppg, 2.9 rpg); F Sagaba Konate, 6-8, So. (10.5 ppg, 7.7 rpg); F Esa Ahmad, 6-8, Jr. (10.6 ppg, 5.3 rpg); F Wesley Harris, 6-8, So. (5.8 ppg, 3.8 rpg).

6. Florida

Nickname: Gators. Location: Gainesville.

Record: 20-12, 11-7. Bid: SEC at-large.

Last appearance: 2017, lost to South Carolina in Elite Eight.

Coach: Mike White (3-1 in one appearance).

Overview: Florida is well-rounded and experienced. The Gators use a four-guard lineup that averages just 9.8 turnovers a game and are eighth overall in turnover margin. Rebounding is a problem: Florida is routinely beaten on the backboard. That can be costly in March.

Projected Starters: G Jalen Hudson, 6-6, Jr. (15.3 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 41.1 3FG%); G Egor Koulechov, 6-5, Sr. (13.6 ppg, 6.5 rpg, 40.3 3FG%, 87.4 FT%); G KeVaughn Allen, 6-2, Jr. (11.3 ppg, 2.4 rpg, 90.1 FT%); G Chris Chiozza, 6-0, Sr. (11.2 ppg, 4.4 rpg, 6.1 apg); F/C Kevarrius Hayes, 6-9, Jr. (4.9 ppg, 5.1 rpg, 57.3 FG%).

7. Arkansas

Nickname: Razorbacks. Location: Fayetteville.

Record: 23-11, 10-8. Bid: SEC at-large.

Last appearance: 2017, lost to North Carolina in Round of 32.

Coach: Mike Anderson (9-8 in eight appearances).

Overview: Arkansas enters the tournament with one of the top offensive units in the country, including two of the SEC’s five scorers (Jaylen Barford and Daryl Macon). Freshman Daniel Gafford is the only player on the team taller than 6-9, and he will be the X-factor, because the Razorbacks have struggled with rebounding.

Projected starters: G Jaylen Barford, 6-3, Sr. (18.2 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 43.2 3FG%); G Daryl Macon, 6-3, Sr. (16.8 ppg, 4.0 apg, 42.5 3FG%, 86.6 FT%); F Daniel Gafford, 6-11, Fr. (12.1 ppg, 6.2 rpg, 2.2 bpg); G Anton Beard, 6-0, Sr. (9.5 ppg, 3.1 apg); F Adrio Bailey, 6-7, So. (4.1 ppg, 2.6 rpg, 55.6 FG%).

8. Virginia Tech

Nickname: Hokies. Location: Blacksburg.

Record: 21-11, 10-8. Bid: ACC at-large.

Last appearance: 2017, lost to Wisconsin in Round of 64.

Coach: Buzz Williams (8-6 in six appearances).

Overview: The Hokies have been dangerous against some of the best teams, beating Virginia, Duke and North Carolina. Four starters average double figures, led by Justin Robinson, who tops the team in scoring and assists. There’s also strength off the bench with Ahmed Hill (10.8 ppg) and Chris Clarke (8.3 ppg, 6.5 rpg). One thing Virginia Tech lacks, however, is size besides Kerry Blackshear.

Projected starters: G Justin Robinson, 6-2, Jr. (13.8 ppg, 5.6 apg, 1.2 spg); G Justin Bibbs, 6-5, Sr. (13.1 ppg, 2.5 rpg); F Kerry Blackshear Jr., 6-10, So. (12.6 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 55.7 FG%); G Nickeil Alexander-Walker, 6-5, Fr. (10.5 ppg, 3.9 rpg); G Devin Wilson 6-4, Sr. (2.9 ppg, 53.8 FG%).

9. Alabama

Nickname: Crimson Tide. Location: Tuscaloosa.

Record: 19-15, 8-10. Bid: SEC at-large.

Last appearance: 2012, lost to Creighton in Round of 64.

Coach: Avery Johnson (first appearance).

Overview: Collin Sexton is one of the best guards in the country, and he has been excellent down the stretch. Alabama struggles from beyond the arc (32.5% from three) and is not a great rebounding team. For Alabama — in the tournament despite 15 losses — to advance, Sexton has to carry the Tide.

Projected starters: G Collin Sexton, 6-3, Fr. (19 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 3.6 apg); F Donta Hall, 6-9, Jr. (10.9 ppg, 6.8 rpg, 2.1 bpg, 72.1 FG%,); G Dazon Ingram, 6-5, So. (10.1 ppg, 5.7 rpg); G Herb Jones, 6-7, Fr. (4.3 ppg, 3.6 rpg); F Galin Smith, 6-9, Fr. (2.7 ppg, 2.0 rpg).

10. Butler

Nickname: Bulldogs. Location: Indianapolis.

Record: 20-13, 9-9. Bid: Big East at-large.

Last appearance: 2017, lost to North Carolina in Sweet 16.

Coach: LaVall Jordan (first appearance).

Overview: The phrase “the Butler way” gets bandied about a lot. There’s clearly something to it, as the Bulldogs keep finding their way to the Dance despite a succession of coaching changes. In his first year at the helm, Jordan has relied on his veteran leaders to keep the ship moving. They’ll struggle to shut down teams with athletic front courts, but they’ll usually make good decisions with the ball.

Projected starters: F Kelan Martin, 6-7, Sr. (20.8 ppg, 6.2 rpg, 83.1 FT%); G Kamar Baldwin, 6-1, So. (15.5 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 3.1 apg); F Tyler Wideman, 6-8, Sr. (9.4 ppg, 5.1 rpg); G Sean McDermott, 6-6, So. (7.3 ppg, 3.8 rpg); G Aaron Thompson, 6-2, Fr. (4.3 ppg, 3.2 apg).

11. St. Bonaventure

Nickname: Bonnies. Location: Allegany, N.Y.

Record: 25-7, 14-4. Bid: Atlantic-10 at-large.

Last appearance: 2012, lost to Florida State in Round of 64.

Coach: Mark Schmidt (0-1 in one appearance).

Overview: Once the Bonnies got healthy during the conference season, they lived up to the potential. Some early losses suffered when Jaylen Adams was sidelined with an ankle injury were nearly too much to overcome, but in the end their résumé was good enough. They can shoot with just about anyone, but they’ll be at a size disadvantage against most potential opponents.

Projected starters: G Jaylen Adams, 6-2, Sr. (19.8 ppg, 3.6 rpg, 5.4 apg); G Matt Mobley, 6-3, Sr. (18.5 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 2.5 apg); C Amadi Ikbeze, 6-10, So. (4.7 ppg, 3.1 rpg); G Idris Taqqee, 6-4, Sr. (5.4 ppg, 4.8 rpg); F Courtney Stockard, 6-5, Jr. (12.9 ppg, 6.4 rpg).

11. UCLA

Nickname: Bruins. Location: Los Angeles.

Record: 21-11, 11-7. Bid: Pac-12 at-large.

Last appearance: 2017, lost to Kentucky in Sweet 16.

Coach: Steve Alford (11-10 in 10 appearances).

Overview: The Bruins tend to seesaw between spectacular (win vs. Arizona on the road) and puzzling (a loss at Oregon State). But they know how to score, 82.4 points a game, and they have a big-time playmaker in Aaron Holiday. The question is if they can contain other teams in crunch time; they allow 76.3 ppg. UCLA has a history of success in the NCAA tournament, too: Besides all those national titles won under legendary coach John Wooden, the Bruins have been to the Sweet 16 three of the last four years.

Projected starters: G Aaron Holiday, 6-1, Jr. (20.3 ppg, 3.6 rpg, 5.8 apg, 43.3 3FG%, 82.6 FT%); G Kris Wilkes, 6-8, Fr. (13.8 ppg, 5.0 rpg); C Thomas Welsh, 7-0, Sr. (13.0 ppg, 10.7 rpg, 40.9 3FG%, 82.8 FT%); F Gyorgy Goloman, 6-11, Sr. (7.3 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 54.5 FG%, 42.9 3FG%); G Prince Ali, 6-3, So. (9.0 ppg, 3.1 rpg).

12. Murray State

Nickname: Racers. Location: Murray, Ky.

Record: 26-5, 16-2. Bid: Ohio Valley champ.

Last appearance: 2012, lost to Marquette in the Round of 32.

Coach: Matt McMahon, first appearance.

Overview: The Racers have won 13 in a row and dominated a strong Belmont team in the Ohio Valley tournament title game. Senior guard Jonathan Stark is an explosive scorer with takeover abilities, and do-everything guard Ja Morant has added a key ingredient to Murray State’s winning formula.

Projected starters: G Jonathan Stark, 6-0, Sr. (21.8 ppg, 3.9 apg, 88.8 FT%); G Ja Morant, 6-3, Fr. (12.6 ppg, 6.6 rpg, 6.4 apg); G Shaq Buchanan, 6-3, Jr. (9.2 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 51.4 FG%); F Terrell Miller Jr., 6-8, Sr. (14.7 ppg, 8.3 rpg); F Brion Sanchious, 6-8, Jr. (3.0 ppg, 2.8 rpg).

13. Marshall

Nickname: Thundering Herd. Location: Huntington, W.Va.

Record: 24-10, 12-6. Bid: Conference USA champ.

Last appearance: 1987, lost to TCU in Round of 64.

Coach: Dan D’Antoni (first appearance).

Overview: The Thundering Herd played spoiler in the C-USA tourney. But this team has some bracket-busting ammunition, with a dynamic offense that ranks in the top 10 in the nation in scoring (85 points a game). Only Marshall has two players who average more than 20 points a game — Jon Elmore and C.J. Burks. Marshall also protects the paint well, with Ajdin Penava, the nation’s leading shot blocker, there to disrupt shooters.

Projected starters: G Jon Elmore, 6-3, Jr. (22.8 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 6.9 apg, 82.8 FT%); G C.J. Burks, 6-4, Jr. (20.5 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 3.1 apg, 89.3 FT%); G Jarrod West, 5-11, Fr. (7.9 ppg, 2.9 apg, 41.5 3FG%); F Ajdin Penava, 6-9, Jr. (15.5 ppg, 8.6 rpg, 4.1 bpg, 55.3 FG%); F Jannson Williams, 6-9, Fr. (5.4 ppg, 3.3 rpg).

14. Stephen F. Austin

Nickname: Lumberjacks. Location: Nacogdoches, Texas.

Record: 28-6, 14-4. Bid: Southland champ.

Last appearance: 2016, lost to Notre Dame in Round of 32.

Coach: Kyle Keller (first appearance).

Overview: Stephen F. Austin was second in the conference in points a game (81.7) and in scoring defense (68.4 ppg). The Lumberjacks, who have been known to bust a bracket or two, are led by junior guard Shannon Bogues (16.0 ppg), sophomore swingman Kevon Harris (14.6) and junior forward T.J. Holyfield (12.9).

Projected starters: G Ty Charles, 6-5, Sr. (8 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 1.63 apg), G Ivan Canete, 6-4, Sr. (9.4 ppg, 3 apg) G/F Kevon Harris, 6-6, So. (14.8 ppg, 5.5 apg), F T.J. Holyfield, 6-8, Jr. (12.9 ppg, 6.3 rpg), F Leon Gilmore III, 6-7, Sr. (9.4 ppg, 5 rpg).

15. Cal State Fullerton

Nickname: Titans. Location: Fullerton.

Record: 20-11, 10-6. Bid: Big West champ.

Last appearance: 2008, lost to Wisconsin in Round of 64.

Coach: Dedrique Taylor (first appearance).

Overview: Cal State Fullerton is efficient on both ends, shooting 47% and holding opponents to 41.7%. But the Titans do not shoot the three a lot or well (33.8%) and they don’t take care of the ball, averaging more 14 turnovers a game.

Projected starters: G Kyle Allman, 6-3, Jr. (19.2 ppg, 3.3 rpg); G Khalil Ahmad, 6-4, Jr. (15.1 ppg, 3.8 rpg); F Jackson Rowe, 6-7, So. (12.4 ppg, 6.9 rpg, 58.7 FG%); G Austen Awosika, 6-3, So. (7.5 ppg, 3.8 rpg); F Arkim Robertson, 6-9, Sr. (5.4 ppg, 4.2 rpg).

16. LIU Brooklyn

Nickname: Blackbirds. Location: Brooklyn, N.Y.

Record: 18-16, 10-8. Bid: Northeast champ.

Last appearance: 2013, lost to James Madison in First Four.

Coach: Derek Kellogg (0-1 in one appearance).

Overview: The Blackbirds made an improbable run to the Northeast tournament title in Kellogg’s first season, capped by a win at No. 1 seed Wagner. Now they bring the momentum of a five-game win streak to their first appearance in five seasons. To keep things going, Joel Hernandez and Raiquan Clark will have to carry the scoring load. A lack of size could be a concern with just one regular taller than 6-6.

Projected starters: G Joel Hernandez, 6-3, Sr. (20.9 ppg, 5.9 rpg, 2.6 apg); G/F Raiquan Clark, 6-6, Jr. (17.4 ppg, 7.1 rpg, 55.6 FG%); G Jashaun Agosto, 5-11, So. (11.7 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 4.1 apg); G Julian Batts, 5-11, So. (10.0 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 40.9 3FG%); F/G Julius van Sauers, 6-8, So. (2.0 ppg, 2.2 rpg).

16. Radford

Nickname: Highlanders. Location: Radford, Va.

Record: 22-12, 12-6. Bid: Big South champ.

Last appearance: 2009, lost to North Carolina in Round of 64.

Coach: Mike Jones (first appearance).

Overview: Radford, picked to finish seventh in the Big South, overachieved. The Highlanders have won seven in a row, including the conference tournament title game against Liberty with a stunning three at the buzzer by Carlik Jones. Radford plays at a deliberate pace and thus doesn’t fill up the stats sheet or light up the scoreboard. The good news is the Highlanders don’t give up a lot of points (64.4 ppg, 16th in the nation). They will need to be efficient and shoot better than their averages (42.6%, 35% from three) to advance. Buzzer-beating threes certainly would help.

Projected starters: G Christian Bradford, 6-1, Sr. (4.2 ppg, 78.6 FT%); G Carlik Jones, 6-0, Fr. (11.8 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 3.0 apg); G Donald Hicks, 6-3, So. (7.8 ppg, 3.4 rpg, 40.3 3FG%); F Ed Polite Jr., 6-5, Jr. (13.5 ppg, 7.7 rpg, 48.5 FG%); C Randy Phillips, 6-8, Sr. (6.9 ppg, 5.7 rpg, 55.2 FG%).
