The Capital Plaza Office Tower in Frankfort, Ky., disappeared on Sunday into a cloud of dust.

There were a few booms of dynamite and then the 28-story building collapsed and crumbled to the ground in a matter of seconds.

A sizable crowd gathered in Frankfort to watch the demolition. Many of them filmed on their smartphones and cheered once the building was gone.

Capital Plaza Office Tower opened in 1972 and closed in 2016, and was the tallest building in Frankfort.

It was imploded to make way for a new 385,500-square-foot, 1,500 employee office building, and a 1,206-space parking structure.

Prior to Sunday, Gov. Matt Bevin and his wife, Glenna, auctioned off the opportunity to ceremonially start the implosion.

Andrew "AJ" Stivers, of Shelbyville, won the eBay auction with a bid of $15,000. Stivers operates Quality Care for Kids, a group of ophthalmologists, pediatricians and trained technicians that provides vision and hearing exams to schools across Kentucky, according to a press release.

Bevin's office they received more than 80 bids. The entirety of the $15,000 winning donation will go to Glenna's foundation, #WeAreKY! Inc., which works to support statewide foster care and adoption initiatives.
