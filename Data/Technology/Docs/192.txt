A noticeably distraught and disgruntled Southern California coach Andy Enfield addressed reporters at a news conference following Selection Sunday’s unveiling, which stunningly kept the Trojans out of the field of 68 — perhaps the worst snub of the night. USC’s RPI of 34 and strong finish — reaching the Pac-12 tourney final vs. Arizona — made it particularly perplexing.

“Our team is very disappointed,” Enfield said. “We deserve to be in the NCAA tournament.”

Enfield started off calm while talking passionately about his team and its credentials that made USC worthy of going dancing.

But his emotion picked up midway through and he was clearly frustrated with the committee’s lack of transparency.

“If all that matters is the quality of your best win on your schedule, than we shouldn’t even play,” Enfield jabbed at the committee. “Set the field in December after non-conference is complete. (The selection committee) basically discredited our entire (Pac-12) league schedule. No matter what we or some of the other teams in Pac-12 tournament did, it obviously didn’t matter.

“We came in second in the Pac-12, a major conference, outright. And then played in the (conference) championship game. … Our RPI is No. 34 in the nation. Our strength of schedule is a 37 which is extremely tough — much tougher than teams in tournament. Teams that made the tournament had RPIs in the 60s and 70s. We have 11 wins away from home. Supposedly, road wins and neutral wins are valued.”
