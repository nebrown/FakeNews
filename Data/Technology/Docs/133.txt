Oculus Rift virtual reality headsets suffer 15 hour outage
Oculus Rift users around the world have been unable to use their devices as part of a global software bug affecting nearly all of the virtual reality headsets.

Users began reporting connection problems yesterday, with most Oculus headsets affected by the problem.

When users attempted to run the Oculus headset, which requires a PC connection through the Oculus App, they are met with the message: "Can't reach Oculus runtime service".

Some were left without power for more than 15 hours on Wednesday, but the Facebook-owned virtual reality company acknowledged the problem on Wednesday, which Oculus co-founder Nate Mitchell said had finally been fixed early Thursday morning.

"Rift is back online as of 12am [Pacific Time]. This was a mistake on our end, and we apologize," Mitchell said on Twitter.
