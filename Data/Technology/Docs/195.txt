Country star Tim McGraw collapsed Sunday night at a performance in Ireland.

His wife, singer Faith Hill, told the crowd that McGraw was suffering from dehydration during a C2C concert in Dublin.

"I apologize, but I made the decision that he cannot come back out onstage," she said in video posted by fans on social media.

A statement sent to The (Nashville) Tennessean on McGraw's behalf said the singer was tended to by medical staff onsite "and he will be fine. He and Faith want to thank everyone for their love and support and look forward to seeing their Irish fans again soon."

C2C stands for Country to Country and is an annual festival that brings Nashville's country stars to England and Ireland for a series of concerts. Other artists participating in the festival include Little Big Town, Sugarland, Kip Moore and Kelsea Ballerini.
