Elon Musk: SpaceX Mars ship could make short flights by next year
Elon Musk said a rocket ship that his company is building for trips to Mars could make short flights by as early as next year.

Space Exploration Technologies Corp., known as SpaceX, is “making good progress on the ship and the booster,” Musk said at the South by Southwest event in Austin, Texas, where he took questions from screenwriter Jonathan Nolan.

“I think we will be able to do short flights, short up and down flights, probably in the first half of next year. This is a very big booster and ship.”

Musk, 46, who’s long dreamed of creating a human colony on Mars, revealed in 2017 that he was building the new rocket ship with the code name “BFR” that would be capable of traveling anywhere on Earth in under an hour.

The spacecraft would ultimately be able to make missions to the Moon or Mars, Musk said.
