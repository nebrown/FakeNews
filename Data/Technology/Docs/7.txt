On International Women's Day, meet the 43 women who inspire CNET
It has been a year filled with a renewed focus on female-empowerment and women speaking out. So for International Women's Day, we asked our team to call out the women who inspire them.

"Being a woman in tech is not easy," nominee Padmasree Warrior says. "Women often feel more pressure to prove themselves every step of the way."

While CNET is focused on the representation and roles of women in tech, this list acknowledges women across disciplines. Each woman featured in our first-ever Inspiring Women list was nominated by a staff member, leading to a diverse list of strong women who have made a difference in their field, from a founding member of #TimesUp to a former federal prosecutor, to a model empowering girls through coding.

This week, Mattel introduced 14 Shero dolls, one-of-a-kind likenesses of women who inspire people around the world. (Sadly, these aren't available for purchase.) Mattel also introduced three Inspiring Women dolls: aviator Amelia Earhart, artist Frida Kahlo and NASA mathematician Katherine Johnson (which you can preorder right now).

All our nominees deserve their own doll, having influenced the fields they work in. We appreciate every person who motivates us. But today, we'd like to give a special shout out to those women who break down barriers, raise up their voices and never take no for an answer. Each and everyone of them is worth knowing and we hope you'll be as inspired by them as we are.
