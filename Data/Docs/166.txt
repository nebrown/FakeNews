Mindy Thomas
Mindy Thomas is the host of NPR's Wow In The World, a podcast and new way for families to connect, look up, and discover the wonders in the world around them. Every episode, she and Guy Raz guide curious kids and their grown-ups away from their screens and on a journey through a combination of careful scientific research and fun.

Thomas is also the Gracie Award-winning host of the inimitable Absolutely Mindy Show. She can be heard weekday mornings on Sirius XM's Kid's Place Live Channel, of which Mindy served as Program Director for ten years. Mindy is known as an expert and advocate for children's literature and independent family music. She's proven that kid's programming can be smart, interesting, and compelling for both children and adults without sacrificing an ounce of silliness. She talks to imaginary friends (her listeners), sends kids on incredible imaginary adventures by flushing them down her "Portal Potty," and has the super ability to keep children and adults laughing together on their morning commutes. She has hosted live events for Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Children's Miracle Network, and Life is Good and conducted thousands of interviews with everyone from The Muppets to Julie Andrews.

When she's not living out her childhood dreams "playing radio," she's exploring the world with her husband and two curious and creative kids. She loves the outdoors, especially kayaking, hiking, and backpacking. She started an adventure club for moms called The Action Adventure Girls Club and she's even jumped out of a plane on a skydiving adventure! She has no plans of ever growing up.
