By Dragon, Drugs Or Giant Peach, Fantastic Trips For Every Reader
Have you read the biography of Crockett Johnson and his wife, Ruth Krauss, the creative geniuses who transformed children's literature? No, me neither, because I've been busy reading their compact, torn, slightly damp (how did it get that way?) board book to my own budding geniuses. Spoiler alert: Harold, a mere child, has left his bedroom. Don't worry. He "think[s] it over for some time." What's more, he has gone by way of an oversized purple crayon. Here's the thing you might not remember about Harold if a short human hasn't sat on your lap in a while — he gets into some real scrapes. Sure, there are the unlimited pies, and a trip to the big city, but there's also a dragon, a near drowning and a quick descent off a mountain. And here's the best part: Everything that scares Harold is something he created — that dragon may be terrifying but it's the dragon he hath made. Harold draws the sea that swallows him and the boat that saves him. And when he gets home again — who can be sure that the bedroom he's drawn, with the moon in the window, is the same one he left? It isn't, really — and that's OK. It's still home — even when something's changed — even when you've changed. And of course, the question that still haunts me: Is Harold going to step on the crayon when he wakes up? That purple's going to leave a mark on the carpet. (For ages 3 to 7)
