Electoral Reform
Canada uses a first-past-the-post electoral system, along with the United States and Britain, which critics say disproportionately favours certain parties. Justin Trudeau's Liberals campaigned on a pledge that the 2015 federal election would be the last under such a system. The Liberal government has convened an all-party parliamentary committee to review a wide variety of reforms, such as ranked ballots, proportional representation, mandatory voting, and online voting.
