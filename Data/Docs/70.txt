Congressman Steve Russell (R-OK) spoke with Brian Kilmeade about his recent visit to Niger to find out more on what happened to the four US troops killed in an ambush by ISIS fighters in October. Russell takes issue with the NY Times call for removing troops from African nations because it would hinder our decades long efforts of working with African nations rooting out terrorism. When it comes to arming school teachers, Congressman Russell believes it should be left up to individual school districts to deal with school safety and said he feels that the film and video game industry need to be more engaged in the fight against gun violence.
