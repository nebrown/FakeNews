Trump speaks to conservatives in CPAC conference
The US president has spoken at the US' largest gathering of conservatives, telling them what they wanted to hear on familiar themes from immigration to North Korea.

Donald Trump also used the speech to again call for teachers to be armed, an idea he proposed after last week's school shooting in Florida.

Al Jazeera's Alan Fisher reports from the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland.
