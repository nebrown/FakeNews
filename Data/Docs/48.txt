It was just another day of high temperatures some 25 to 30 degrees above normal, which smashed records in the area. Sometimes it feels like it’s not that big a deal, but it is. If you went wandering outside recently, your body probably could tell something was up. It felt a whole lot more like May than February. That’s the story through Wednesday, ahead of a cold front.

Through Tonight: If you thought it felt weird outside today, just wait until after dark when it’s still warm and fairly muggy. With that heightened moisture level in the air, temperatures can only fall so far. Tonight, we’re talking mainly in the mid-50s to near-60. That’s typical for high temperatures we would expect to see — in the upcoming month. Try to enjoy with a long evening walk, or something.

Tomorrow (Wednesday): Temperatures might be dictated somewhat by cloud cover, but if history is any guide, the day before a cold front is often the warmest. In that sense, it’s tempting to run to the 80s most spots, despite that being about as warm as it can get this early in the year. But, given the cloud cover question, upper-70s and low-80s seem a better idea for now. Even then, it’s more record and new-record stuff. For Washington, the target is 75, which was set in 1953. Any rain with the front should tend to hold off until evening or overnight, but it’s worth introducing a slight chance by late afternoon.

Creeping spring: It’s about the time of year we often start to see the first blossoms and other signs of spring. So far, things are running ahead of schedule to our south as spring invades Virginia while working this way. Of course, all we have to do is look to last year when we had a crazy warm February, and then March reminded us it was still the cold season. See more from the National Phenology Network.
