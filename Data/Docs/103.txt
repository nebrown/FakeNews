"Good Morning Britain" anchor Piers Morgan said former President Barack Obama failed to properly combat Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

"Whose job was it to deal with that meddling?" he asked rhetorically on "Tucker Carlson Tonight." "Barack Obama - It was his job, it was on his watch."

Morgan said there has been "zero evidence" produced to show President Donald Trump colluded with "anyone" prior to his electoral victory.

"[Robert] Mueller may have some secret evidence, but he hasn't produced it," Morgan said.

Morgan said Obama had 17 American intelligence agencies at his disposal but did not act on reports that Russia was involving themselves in U.S. affairs.

He said that one of those agencies, the FBI, similarly committed a "spectacular ball-drop" by failing to act on tips about Florida shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz.

"[Tipsters] gave them chapter and verse on this bloke," Morgan said, adding that none of the tips were forwarded to the local field office in Miami-Dade County, Fla.
