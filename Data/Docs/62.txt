The president needs a better hobby

The president did not enjoy Presidents’ Day weekend. As the White House would put it, the tweets speak for themselves.

Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign – there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2018

General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2018

As my Washington Post colleagues Josh Dawsey and Philip Rucker reported, Trump’s “defiant and error-laden tweetstorm that was remarkable even by his own combative standards” appeared to be a function of his being cooped up in Mar-a-Lago:

After visiting victims of the Parkland shooting and first responders at an area hospital on Friday evening, Trump did not leave Mar-a-Lago until Sunday evening, skipping his usual rounds of golf at his nearby course in what aides described as a decision to show respect for the 17 people killed in the school massacre. Instead, Trump spent his time watching television, talking with friends and tweeting, aides said.

As of late Sunday, it was still pretty obvious that Trump was doing little but watching television:

Just watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey, who at one point I knew very well, interview a panel of people on 60 Minutes. The questions were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect. Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2018

Most of the president’s weekend tweets were repugnant, but the motivations were not hard to divine. The Oprah Winfrey tweet was genuinely baffling; if he had bothered to listen, Trump could have found much to like in that segment.

The mood is so bad in the West Wing that Trump officials admitted the Florida shooting was a “reprieve” from the political chaos. That official also told The Post’s Ashley Parker and Philip Rucker: “But as we all know, sadly, when the coverage dies down a little bit, we’ll be back through the chaos.”

The hard-working staff here at Spoiler Alerts would like to be able to wake up in the morning and not wade through a dozen error-filled, offensive presidential tweets. Clearly, however, the president’s executive time, combined with a tsunami of bad political news, leads to this kind of reaction.

Rather than have White House staffers yearn for another school shooting, let me suggest an alternative: The president needs to start binge-watching television shows.

This is not my first choice, and it’s not my second, either. But the president seems committed to “executive time,” which means he is going to be watching a lot of television. At the same time, Trump does not like coverage of himself outside the Fox News bubble. Furthermore, on some level, I suspect even Trump knows that he can’t trust what anyone on Fox News says about him, anyway.

Rather than get angry watching more news coverage of himself, maybe Trump needs to do what many Americans do during their own version of executive time: watch something on Netflix that has no commercial interruption. Here are three modest suggestions that might entertain the president and nudge him toward some less-bigoted thinking:

1. “Parks and Recreation.” What better way for Trump to learn about the whole governing thing than by watching a show about local government? I worry that the humor might go over Trump’s head, but I am sure he would love Ron Swanson and his pyramid of greatness.

2. “Star Trek.” The original series is perfect for Trump. He’ll identify with the emotionalism of Leonard McCoy and the virility of Captain Kirk. If the president’s focus starts to wander, the old-style Starfleet miniskirts will likely hold his attention. Without even realizing it, Trump might learn about the values of multilateralism and free trade as practiced by the United Federation of Planets.

3. “Mad Men.” When Trump says he wants to make America great again, I suspect this is the era that comes to his mind. Plus, I am sure that when Donald Trump looks in the mirror, he sees Donald Draper is looking back at him. So let him watch this award-winning series to learn that nostalgia has its limits.

Really, I’m trying to help the president here. It would be better if he actually read the documents he claimed to read. In the absence of diligence, however, I would prefer that the president unwind rather than get wound up.

So for God’s sake, John F. Kelly, show the president of the United States how to use Netflix.
