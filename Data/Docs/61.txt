White House severs ties with unpaid adviser to Melania Trump
The White House said Tuesday that it had severed ties to Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who served as an unpaid adviser to first lady Melania Trump and ran a company that received $26 million from the presidential inaugural committee.

White House officials declined to say why it ended its relationship with Wolkoff, who served as a volunteer adviser in the East Wing.

“The Office of the First Lady severed the gratuitous services contract with Ms. Wolkoff,” spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement, referring to her unpaid status. “We thank her for her hard work and wish her all the best.”

The amount of money that flowed to Wolkoff’s firm was made public earlier this month in tax filings.

The Trumps had not been aware that her company had received such large sums and did not want the matter to be a distraction, according to a person familiar with the situation who requested anonymity to discuss internal issues.

Wolkoff’s departure was first reported by the New York Times.

Her firm passed along the vast majority of the inaugural committee money — $24 million — to other vendors who provided entertainment, staffing and other services, according to a committee document detailing the spending. Wolkoff, who employed about a dozen staff members for the event, retained $1.62 million for consulting and executive production, according to a person familiar with the arrangement.

Wolkoff could not be reached for comment. She said in an email to the Times that the $1.62 million that her firm retained was divided among 15 people, including herself. She said she expected to informally “remain a trust source for advice and support” to Melania Trump.
