In this 'boots on the ground' episode of "War Stories," you'll get a gripping, inside understanding of covert intelligence collection, high risk meets with clandestine informants, and rapid response capture-kill missions. From three month-long embeds with US soldiers and Marines, Special Operations units and the DEA, our "War Stories" team takes you on heart-thumping raids into Taliban strongholds, and you'll meet the unsung heroes who fight in the shadows to take down the Taliban.
