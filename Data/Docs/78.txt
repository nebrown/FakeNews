Audio clip: Listen to audio clip.

This wasn't supposed to be a weekly podcast...

Dana Perino, former White House Press Secretary, co-host of Fox News Channel's "The Five" and host of "The Daily Briefing" and Chris Stirewalt Fox News Politics Editor and host of "Power Play", run through the daily goings on in the world of politics.

Dana and Chris celebrate their 100th podcast. This week they discuss the latest on the Stormy Daniels controversy, Elon Musk Space X project and the DACA debate but not before they take a stroll down memory lane.

Plus, Dana reads listener reviews and Chris tackles infrastructure based trivia.
