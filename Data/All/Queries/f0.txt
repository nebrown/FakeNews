Whether you’re a developer who’s working on mobile apps, or just someone enjoying the millions of apps available for your phone, today is a very special day.

It’s the 10-year anniversary of the original iPhone SDK. I don’t think it’s an understatement to say that this release changed a lot of people’s lives. I know it changed mine and had a fundamental impact on this company’s business. So let’s take a moment and look back on what happened a decade ago.

What Trump calls ‘conflict,’ many Americans call ‘chaotic’
© AP Photo/Evan Vucci President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference with Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven in the East Room of the White House, Tuesday, March 6, 2018, in Washington.

President Trump likes conflict.

It’s fair to say that many Americans already knew this, or were not surprised to see him confess that during a news conference featuring the Swedish prime minister.

One of the main responses from his surrogates and supporters when called upon to defend Trump’s latest attack against his political opponents — and sometimes even those within his own party — is that the president likes to “punch back.”

But at Tuesday’s news conference, he explained why he values conflict even among his staff:



“I like conflict. I like having two people with different points of view. And I certainly have that. And then I make a decision. But I like watching it. I like seeing it. I think it’s the best way to go. I like different points of view.”

But Trump’s approach to problem-solving may actually not be the best way to go in the eyes of the American public. And it could wind up hurting him with voters. What Trump may be calling conflict, many Americans see as chaos.

Workplace conflict is not uncommon. And when handled appropriately, some experts view it as an opportunity to come up with helpful answers to real problems. But when allowed to fester or perhaps worse, when it’s encouraged, it can lead to more problems than solutions that can have real ramifications for the people an organization claims to serve.

Since entering the White House, there have been constant reports of factions among Trump’s staff competing with one another, leaking unfavorable stories to the media that paint co-workers in a bad light, and simply failing to work together to actually make America “great.”

With high staff turnover as one of the most obvious examples, some have pointed to internal conflicts as the most significant obstacle the Trump White House faces when trying to accomplish the president’s vision for the country.

Part of this is because of the relative ideological diversity of the Trump White House. In addition to having hard-line conservatives competing with establishment Republicans to carry out Trump's agenda, the president’s staff has even brought in some Democrats. But the fundamental depths of some of these conflicts may be presenting challenges that aren’t working in Trump’s — or the American public’s — favor, and voters have taken notice.

In a Washington Post poll reflecting on 2017, “chaotic” was the most common one-word summation of the year.

Other negative words that made the list in people’s one-word summations of the year include “crazy,” “challenging,” “tumultuous,” “horrendous,” “disappointing” and “disastrous.” And large majorities attributed this perspective to Trump’s job performance, the U.S. political system as a whole and the direction in which the country is going.

Trump often points to the strong economy as proof of how smoothly his administration is running, but when Americans were asked to name the nation’s No. 1 problem, the option receiving the highest votes — 22 percent — was “dissatisfaction with government/poor leadership.”

Although Trump saw a temporary bump earlier this year, the percentage of Americans approving of Trump’s job performance is back in the 30s. If this does not improve, Trump may have a more difficult time getting voters to back him in his next presidential run — or perhaps more importantly, during his party’s attempts to remain successful during this fall’s midterm elections.

Sam Nunberg Says Wise MSNBC Analyst Convinced Him Not To Defy Mueller Subpoena
After going on a defiant media spree on Monday, former Trump campaign aide Sam Nunberg said Tuesday that he would comply with special counsel Robert Mueller’s subpoena to appear before a federal grand jury regarding Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

Though he’d bombastically claimed the opposite on multiple cable news shows, Nunberg did suggest to The Associated Press on Monday that he’d change his mind. And by Tuesday, he’d done just that.

Apparently, it was something he heard on MSNBC’s “The Beat with Ari Melber” that led him to reconsider his position.

Nunberg told The Washington Post that listening to fellow guest Maya Wiley, a civil rights activist, lawyer and New School professor who previously served as New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s chief counsel, was the reason he changed his mind.

He described Wiley as “very, very smart” and said she “made a compelling case to me.”

Watch the moment @mayawiley convinced Sam Nunberg to comply with Mueller Grand Jury subpoena: pic.twitter.com/Aa5K5dfUAN — TheBeat w/Ari Melber (@TheBeatWithAri) March 6, 2018

Wiley, a racial justice expert, joined the MSNBC segment shortly after Nunberg noted that he had been fired from the Trump campaign following the discovery of racially charged Facebook posts that he’d allegedly authored.

She pointed out to him that if Mueller had offered him immunity, as Nunberg said, he personally didn’t have any reason not to testify. Then she noted that failing to testify would be a disservice to his self-described mentor, Roger Stone.

“It actually makes it appear that Roger Stone has something to hide because you will not go testify,” Wiley said.

As for Nunberg’s complaints about how much time complying with the subpoena would take, Wiley was incredulous.

“You’d rather possibly spend a year in jail than spend 80 hours going through emails?” she asked.

In a statement on Tuesday to MSNBC, Wiley said:

I joined the set after Sam Nunberg referenced his racially offensive statements that got him fired from the Trump campaign, dismissing their relevance because they wouldn’t have lost Trump a vote. Unspoken was his willingness to use the “N” word in reference to black leaders. That Nunberg actually recognizes the value and intelligence of a black woman is, I hope, a life lesson for him. I assume he has sought the advice and counsel of his lawyer. I hope what I gave him was a sense of humanity we need now more than ever in this country.

Listening for the amphibian apocalypse
John D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion who focuses on climate change and social justice. Follow him on Snapchat , Facebook and email . This story is part CNN's " Vanishing " series. Learn more about the sixth extinction and get involved .

La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica (CNN) The "blue jeans" frog is practically screaming to be noticed. Its head is blood red, and its legs are denim blue. It looks like it's wearing jeggings. But this little critter, also known as the strawberry poison dart frog, is only about the size of a fingernail. It spends most of its time either high up in the trees in this Central American rainforest or rooting around in the gooey "leaf litter" of the forest floor.

As such, it's practically invisible.

Unless you open your ears.

Chit-chit-chit-chit-chit.

"It sounds like an insect. It buzzes."

That's Bryan Pijanowski, a "soundscape ecologist" from Purdue University and one of the few people paying attention to the fact that nature -- especially the amphibian part -- is growing exceptionally quiet these days. Pijanowski and collaborators from around the world have been strapping audio recorders to trees here at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. The microphones look like funny little robots -- boxes with windscreen ears on each side.

Researchers have installed microphone sensors in the rainforeset to listen for the sound of extinction.

The equipment has a critical mission.

It's listening for the sound of extinction.

Have you heard it already? I ask Pijanowski.

"I think so," he tells me. His muted, baritone voice sounds like a public radio host sharing secrets with you in a library. "There is evidence all around the world."

'Rapid extinctions'

Scientists fear Earth is on the verge of the sixth era of extinction.

There have been five mass extinctions in the planet's history.

Biologists fear we are on the verge of -- or have already entered -- the sixth era of extinction in Earth's history.

If we usher in the sixth, three-quarters of all species could disappear in a couple of centuries, says Anthony Barnosky, executive director of the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve at Stanford and author of "Dodging Extinction: Power, Food, Money and the Future of Life on Earth."

"The best way to envision the sixth mass extinction," he told me, "is to look outside and then just imagine that three out of every four of the species that were common out there are gone."

If you study amphibians, it can seem like that dystopian future already is here.

About 10% of birds and a third of mammals are at high extinction risk.

Not good.

But more than 40% of amphibians are in similar straits -- making them worse off than any other vertebrate group, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Amphibians are vanishing without warning, and often without explanation.

Chytrid fungus, which humans helped spread, has decimated frog populations around the world.

"In the past 30 years or so, we've seen really dramatic, really rapid extinctions for frog populations all over the world," says Steven Whitfield, a conservation ecologist at Zoo Miami who joined Pijanowski and me on the visit to Costa Rica this summer. "Many of these extinctions are due to habitat loss. But other extinctions have occurred in pristine rainforests like this -- places that look healthy but the frogs are telling us there's something clearly wrong."

'Unable to see it'

Whitfield spent years studying frogs at this research station in this particular forest.

I ask him to show me how it's done.

It doesn't take long to realize it's not easy work. When Whitfield conducts a study, he often ropes off a small plot of land and then spends hours searching for every single frog he can find.

The search begins with his ears.

CNN Map

"I'll hear [a frog] call and spend half an hour or more looking into a small patch of vegetation, knowing that it's right there and that I need to find it but unable to see it," he tells me.

Whitfield is an expert at pulling frog sounds out of the EDM freak-out that is the rainforest. If you've been, then you know these places, in healthy conditions, are LOUD. I actually had a hard time falling asleep some nights in Costa Rica because it sounded (awesomely) like the forest was yelling at me; and I woke up early to screams of howler monkeys. (Fun aside: Researchers warn newcomers to always wear shoes -- because, vipers -- and to watch the trees, since the "bullet ant," which delivers the world's most painful bite, like a bullet, is all around.)

Whitfield's amphibian-listening powers are impressive, but even he has trouble finding frogs by sight. He takes me and a group of researchers from the Center for Global Soundscapes deep into the forest just after dusk one evening, when some frogs tend to be the most active. Our headlamps provide a washed-out sort of tunnel vision of the diversity hiding all around us.

A Mexican Treefrog at La Selva Biological Station, which is a hub for field ecology.

Whitfield can hear and identify frogs at great distance. There's the "chit-chit-chit" of the blue jeans frog (the one with jeggings), the panicked meowing of a creature aptly nicknamed the "kitten frog." He hears the slot-machine rattle of the "glass frog," which has a translucent belly, allowing you to see organs through its skin. Smoky jungle frogs scream like human babies when they're threatened, and the tink frog seems to be named for its metallic call, which sounds like that ear-piercing noise a smoke detector makes when it wants you to change its battery.

This place is way beyond "ribbit." The sounds are staggering.

But finding these frogs by sight?

That's more difficult.

In a couple of hours, we saw only a handful of frogs.

Spiders almost seem easier to come by.

"Those bite," Whitfield says, pointing to one. "Don't touch that."

'Something is happening'

I'm grateful for the research Whitfield and other field ecologists have contributed when it comes to frogs. Their diligent, painstaking, searching-through-the-leaves work is how we know important (and fun) frog facts, like that the female blue jeans frog is an amphibian supermom.

A view from the forest canopy at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica.

Her tadpoles hatch on the forest floor, he says, but that's a precarious place for them, so she carries them, on her back, high up into the forest canopy, sometimes 10 to 15 meters off the ground -- about 33 to 50 feet. She drops the tadpoles off in little puddles of water up there in the forest canopy and makes a mental note of their location. She does this again and again, leaving her young all over the forest canopy. She remembers where all these tadpoles are (!!) and spends her days climbing the trees to deliver food.

"That's pretty complicated behavior for a tiny little frog," Whitfield says.

His research also has helped show that frogs at La Selva are in decline.

"We have really good long-term data on what's been happening with frog populations over four decades," he tells me. "In the forest here now, there's only about 25% as many frogs as there were sustained throughout the 1970s. And for us, that's a concern because it says that something is happening to this rainforest but we don't fully understand what that is."

The strawberry poison dart frog is sometimes called the blue jeans frog.

That's worth stating again.

Locally, only a quarter of the frogs from the 1970s remain.

Meanwhile, the human population jumped from less than 4 billion to 7.4 billion today.

Whitfield's search-the-forest work is critical.

But even he would say it could use a technological assist.

That's where Pijanowski and his tree-hugging microphones come in.

He's listening for changes Whitfield might not be able to see.

'Your ears ring'

Bryan Pijanowski is an ecologist by training. Before that, he was a "quiet alterboy-ish kind of kid" in the Midwest who also was sort of an audiophile -- and an amateur musician. He played guitar in a high school band called Destruction. "Everybody wanted you to play 'Freebird,'" he said, "so that's what I played -- over and over again."

In school, he set out to become a medical doctor but changed his mind after hearing the "dawn chorus" of a swamp in Michigan. He became obsessed with nature and its music.

Bryan Pijanowski is a "soundscape ecologist" from Purdue University. He's also director of the Center for Global Soundscapes.

So he studied birds and ecology, and eventually turned to "soundscapes," the emerging field of using sound to understand the shifts in the health and function of ecosystems.

The work makes him so sound-focused he now has to wear earplugs to sleep.

He can't stop listening.

"There are times when [the rainforest] is almost too loud," he tells me.

"It's like being too close to the speakers at a concert. Your ears ring."

La Selva is now one of his study sites. He's working to develop others around the world, including underwater to listen for changes to coral reefs. His microphones have taken him to the tip of South America and the deserts of Mongolia. But this site is special both because the rainforest is nearly untouched -- and because there's so much data. Pijanowski got his hands on recordings that date back to 2008 and started making his own recordings here in 2010. At the peak of his research, he'd installed 34 microphone sensors.

Now he has 255,000 recordings here, totaling about 6.8 years of tape.

He's still analyzing the data with the help of computer algorithms.

What he's heard -- or rather, what he doesn't hear -- definitely freaks him out.

'Acoustic fossils'

One evening, insects and frogs chattering outside, Pijanowski sits me down in an open-window classroom at the research station and shows me some of his sound files.

He visualizes the audio in charts called spectrograms.

These charts illuminate trends that a walk through the forest can't.

Take a look at this La Selva recording from 2008.

And then another from 2015, recorded under similar conditions.

Hear the difference?

Those are just two moments.

Pijanowski's team can compress a year's worth of sound into one chart.

Take a look at what happens when you look at those years side by side. The red parts of the charts indicate more audible activity. The main frog frequencies grow much bluer, and quieter.

A year of audio is compressed into spectrograms. Red indicates more sound coming from the forest. Blue is much quieter.

It's too soon to draw scientific conclusions from this, Pijanowski tells me.

But he's frightened.

"I'm worried that these would potentially become acoustic fossils," he says.

"In other words, the animals that are in these files are no longer alive. And the only record that we have of some of their presence is in an audio recording.

"That is somewhat disturbing to me, as a scientist and also as a citizen of this planet."

A collaborator of Pijanowski's, Michael Towsey, tells me he has a file of an Australian frog that's thought to be extinct -- a recording that already is an acoustic fossil.

You can listen to that frog's call here on the Internet.

But you can no longer hear it in nature.

'Most beautiful sound in the world'

Why does this matter?

There's the self-interested argument.

Here's Steven Whitfield's take on that.

"We are all dependent on the planet for clean water, for oxygen. And ecosystems not only provide food to people but rainforests like this are an important source of medicines. Some of the frogs that live in the rainforest here have chemicals in their skin that have been found to be important medicines. They can be painkillers or heart medicines. So these are things that can be really useful for medicine. And we'd like to not lose those. If we do lose those, it hurts us all."

Frog populations at La Selva Biological Station have plunged 75% since the 1970s, according to Steven Whitfield, Zoo Miami.

There's the ecosystem collapse argument.

Bryan Pijanowski: "Some of the theoretical work that we're doing and ecology suggests that we could have ecosystem collapse. And that's not good ... You don't wanna start removing organisms and expect the ecosystem to survive and function in a healthy way. It could very well mean that some of the things that we are much more emotionally attached to are lost."

That should be enough to sway a pragmatist.

Still, I think there's a more human reason you should care about the disappearance of amphibians.

Chances are you never or rarely see frogs in your day-to-day life. But when you learn about them -- those with translucent bellies, supermom instincts, blue-jean legs and poisonous skin, all of which are calling to be noticed by each other if not by us -- then it's hard to ignore their plight.

There are multiple causes of the amphibian apocalypse, but all the trouble points back to us. We've helped carry a killer fungus, called chytrid, around the globe, with disastrous consequences. Climate change has been implicated in frog die-offs. Pollution is a big problem since frogs live part-time in water and basically breathe through their skin.

They are the front lines -- the most vulnerable of species.

Yet few of us seem truly outraged by their disappearance.

Maybe that will change if we start listening more closely.

After all, frog choruses are some of the most fascinating songs in nature.

One recording from the island of Borneo -- called "dusk by the frog pond" -- was voted by the always-wise Internet as "the most beautiful sound in the world."

It's not too late to stop the sixth extinction from taking permanent hold of us, according to Barnosky, the Stanford researcher. We have at most 20 years to change our ways.

There's hope. But we must ditch fossil fuels, mitigating climate change. We have to stop the spread of invasive species and disease. And, in the view of one prominent biologist, we must set aside half the planet for the benefit of biodiversity and nature.

Otherwise, we risk silencing the frogs.

And perhaps the rest of nature, too.

'We are failing the elephants'
At least that's how I remember it. I was 7.

I'm wedged between a cousin and my father, my grandmother perched behind. We are in the back of an open pickup near the banks of the Olifants River in South Africa.

"Drive!" we shout at my uncle in the cab, banging on the roof.

But banging on the roof is our signal to stop.

The truck stops and the elephant is right behind us. We can see the milk discharging from her teats. Her newborn is somewhere hidden in the bushes.

My dad pulls out an antique double-barreled shotgun. He loads it with birdshot to fire in the air.

"Don't shoot the elephant," my gran cries and smacks him.

It would be like shooting an elephant with a tic-tac.

I am crying, and so is my cousin. We smell the elephant musk; we can see the horizon through its legs.

My uncle sees the elephant looming in his rearview mirror. He hits the accelerator.

Outrunning the charging animal, we bounce along the dirt track. Shortly after, she turns back.

We are safe. Right around the corner, the truck's axle breaks in an aardvark hole.

My family often recounts this story. And from that incident, I learned elephants had to be respected -- even feared.

It means no worries

Imagine my alarm, then, nearly 30 years later, when I am assigned by CNN to a story in the Maasai Mara in Kenya.

The Great Elephant Census found 30% of African elephants disappeared over seven years.

The guide drives right up to a breeding herd of elephants in the grasslands and promptly switches off the engine.

"Shouldn't we keep it on," I say, "and maybe not be so close."

"The elephants here are relaxed," he smiles, "Hakuna Matata."

Meaning: "No worries."

I can't understand it. The elephants don't charge. They do not seem agitated, as has been my experience. They completely ignore us.

To be sure, elephants can be dangerous -- and sometimes deadly. But in this section of the Mara, there hasn't been hunting for decades. They are used to the tourist vehicles.

The game farm from my childhood near Olifants bordered a hunting reserve to the west. At the time, they still culled elephants in Kruger National Park to the east.

The elephants knew.

"Elephants have a cognitive sense of where they are safe and where they are at risk," Mike Chase, the lead scientist on the Great Elephant Census, told me on a recent trip to Botswana, where he's been tracking elephant movements for years. The census is a pioneering pan-African aerial survey that aims to count the continent's savanna elephant populations.

"This is really the front line, this is as far as they come, they will no longer move across eastern Namibia into Angola and Zambia, fearful of the consequences of poaching," says Chase.

As poaching rises, the elephants know to stay away.

And they remember.

No, they don't forget

It's sometimes tempting to anthropomorphize -- to give an animal human characteristics -- but the more I speak to people about elephants, the more elephants seem special.

I met up with Chase with Ingrid Formanek, one of CNN's most experienced field producers.

Ingrid's connection to Botswana runs deep.

In 1999 she moved to Maun, on the doorstep of the Okavango Delta, to document the rehabilitation of elephants. She lived there on and off for five years.

She remembered me with that simple gesture. She took the hat off my head and put it on hers. She then put it back. Ingrid Formanek, CNN

Ingrid recounts the story of an elephant orphaned in the Kruger culls, called Shireni.

Shireni's handler taught her a trick: to remove her handler's hat with her trunk and to put it on her own head and then to put it back on her handler's. Ingrid observed as the elephant learned the behavior.

Nearly a decade later, Ingrid went back and saw Shireni.

"She remembered me with that simple gesture. She took the hat off my head and put it on hers. She then put it back. She made the link to that time in our lives," says Ingrid. ""Shireni hadn't done that in all the interim years. I was amazed, and truth be told, flattered."

Anybody who has studied or worked with elephants has their own stories about how sharp elephant memories are.

Experts like Dame Daphne Sheldrick, who has rescued hundreds of orphaned calves, talks about elephants remembering people years later, and the things that happened to them -- good and bad.

Sheldrick speaks of elephants reintroduced to the wild who have returned years, sometimes decades, later for help with an injury or just to say "hello."

Vanishing herds

Despite their obvious emotional intelligence and survival instincts, elephants can't escape the ravages of humans.

Elephants are slaughtered by poachers who seek their ivory tusks.

Before European colonization, scientists believe that Africa may have held as many as 20 million elephants; by 1979 only 1.3 million remained -- and the Great Elephant Census revealed this year that things have gotten far worse.

In the seven years between 2007 and 2014, numbers plummeted by at least 30%, or 144,000 elephants.

As of July, Africa's savannah is now home to only 352,271 elephants, according to the Great Elephant Census . Overall, including forest elephants, there are thought to be between 400,000 and 500,000 elephants across Africa.

And the specific cases are even more disturbing: In the Selous Game Reserve in Tanzania, and Mozambique's Niassa Reserve, elephant populations have plummeted by more than 75% in the past 10 years as poachers cut down family herds, according to the survey.

"When you think of how many elephants occurred in areas 10 or 20 years ago, it's incredibly disheartening," says Chase.

"Historically these ecosystems supported many thousands of elephants compared to the few hundreds or tens of elephants we counted."

In Botswana, elephants were long thought to be safe. It was part of southern Africa's "haven" that comprises 60% of all savannah elephants counted in the census.

But the ivory poaching wars, driven primarily by Asian demand, are on its doorstep.

Historically these ecosystems supported many thousands of elephants compared to the few hundreds or tens of elephants we counted. Mike Chase, Great Elephant Census

Botswana is fighting an unconventional war to try to stop the slaughter, with the Botswana Defense Force mobilized throughout the border region.

More than 700 specially trained soldiers are stationed in 40 bases in the far north.

That protection no longer seems enough.

A new memory

From a distance, it appears the elephant could be resting. But the smell reveals the truth.

A once glorious bull lies lifeless in a dry section of the Linyanti swamp in Botswana. His face hacked off by poachers.

As we approach, we see the tusks have been taken. The trunk is 10 paces from the body. The carcass is perhaps two or three days old. And it is just one of more than 20 we have counted in Linyanti in just over 48 hours.

Now, with current rates of poaching, they will be wiped out from some of their range states.

They could even go locally extinct, says Chase.

"I've been asked if I'm optimistic or pessimistic about the future of Africa's elephants," he says, "and on days like today, I feel that we are failing the elephants."

This horrific scene could be the only way we remember them.

Broadway Star Ruthie Ann Miles Injured, 4-Year-Old Daughter Killed In Car Crash
Broadway star Ruthie Ann Blumenstein, who goes by the stage name Ruthie Ann Miles, was injured in a car crash on Monday.

Her 4-year-old daughter, Abigail, was killed when they were both struck by a car in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn, according to NBC 4 New York.

A white Volvo reportedly drove into a crowd of people after running a red light around 1 p.m. near the intersection of Ninth Street and Fifth Avenue. A 46-year-old man and another woman, Lauren Lew, were also injured. Lew’s 1-year-old son was pronounced dead at the scene.

The two children and their mothers had reportedly recently left a church event at a local community center when the accident occurred.

Miles, who is currently expecting her second child, was critically injured but in stable condition, police said.

Walter McBride via Getty Images Ruthie Ann Miles and Abigail pose alongside Jake Gyllenhaal, whom Miles starred with in "Sunday in the Park with George."

The driver, Dorothy Bruns, 44, reportedly told police that she had medical issues. The New York Daily News reported that relatives said she suffered from a seizure while driving. She was arrested at the scene and has not been charged. Mayor Bill DeBlasio said an investigation is underway.

The actress won a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical for the 2015 revival of the musical “The King & I.” She has starred in “Sunday in the Park with George” alongside Jake Gyllenhaal and previously had a recurring role on the FX spy series “The Americans.”

Many in the Broadway community, including Lin-Manuel Miranda, Ben Platt and Kristin Chenoweth, expressed their condolences for Miles on social media after the news broke.

This incredible woman of unimaginable kindness and goodness and talent is going through the absolutely unthinkable. Please help @RuthieAnnMiles if you can. https://t.co/04QK6pTf68 — Ben Platt (@BenSPLATT) March 6, 2018

Imagine a world without giraffes
John D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion who focuses on climate change and social justice. Follow him on Snapchat , Facebook and email . This story is part of CNN's " Vanishing " series. Learn more about the sixth extinction and get involved .

Its construction-crane neck, toothpick legs, knocked knees and two-story stature make it an awkwardly lovable favorite of children's book authors and cartoonists. This animal brings an odd sort of wonder to the savannahs of Africa.

But perhaps it's best for us to start imagining a world without the humble giraffe.

It moves up from the category called "least concern."

The reason: a sharp 36% to 40% decline in giraffe populations in recent decades.

In 1985, the group said, there were as many as 163,452 giraffes.

Now the estimate is 97,562.

This puts the giraffe in good company. The elephant, the orangutan, certain bees, coral -- so many of the Earth's mind-blowingly cool creatures face extinction risk these days. If poaching rates continue, some fear African elephants will be extinct in 20 years. Scientists worry coral reefs will mostly vanish by 2050 because humans continue pumping fossil fuels into the atmosphere, warming up the oceans and making them more acidic, and making life hard for coral.

I've spent much of 2016 reporting on the mass extinction event that's brewing all around the world for a CNN series called "Vanishing." That reporting will debut on CNN International on Friday and on this website Monday morning.

If there's one take-away from my travels, it's this: We can't take species for granted.

We too often assume they'll survive one generation to the next -- that those elephants or giraffes will be out there, somewhere.

They won't. Not unless we humans drastically change our ways.

In California, I met with Anthony Barnosky, executive director of Stanford University's Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve , and a global expert on extinction. He told me that we humans have -- at the very most -- 20 years to change the way we treat nature or we will bring about the sixth mass extinction event in the entire history of Earth. We are talking dinosaur-ending stuff here -- as in three-quarters of all known species, not just the cute and iconic ones, could vanish in a couple of centuries.

Having trouble imagining that world?

"The best way to envision the sixth mass extinction is to look outside and then just imagine that three out of every four of the species that were common out there are gone," he said. "That would be a very impoverished landscape."

It certainly would.

If you're not moved by that, consider the consequences for humans, too.

"We are basically annihilating the life on our planet -- and that is the only known life ... in the entire universe," Paul Ehrlich, also of Stanford, told me. "It's life that shaped the planet, that made it possible for us to live here. It's life that still makes it possible for us to live here. (If) we don't have the diversity of other organisms, we're done."

What's causing the collapse?

Barnosky has boiled it all down to three words: "power, food and money."

Power, meaning we're burning fossil fuels for electricity, transit and heat. That's warming the planet and wreaking havoc all over the world. We're not just talking polar bears here -- amphibians, oceans, everything is affected.

By food, he's referring to the fact that humans have plowed up or otherwise altered about 40% of the Earth's surface, he said, for agricultural production, much of it for livestock. Some biologists think we have to set aside huge chunks of land -- 50% of the Earth, according to Harvard University's E.O. Wilson -- to stop the sixth extinction from occurring, or to lessen its scope.

Add the population boom to this and you can see why farms are going to be a big issue this century.

Finally, money. That means poaching -- illegal networks are decimating the populations of some animals, including elephants, rhinos and the pangolin . And it means thinking of nature as an endless vat of cash.

"How do we get off of treating nature as this bottomless checking account and begin to treat it as an investment account, where we're living off the interest?" Barnosky asked during our interview.

I'm not sure how we'll change. But I have to hope that understanding the scope of this crisis is part of moving toward solutions. Giraffes are constricted by human development; they're poached for their tails, which are used as bracelets, and for their meat, according to the African Wildlife Foundation . We shouldn't see the giraffe's plight as an isolated crisis. Humans are reshaping the face of Earth as never before. It happens in slow motion, making us easily distracted from the cumulative destruction one generation passes to the next. And many of us are so disconnected from nature -- we see it through car windows, from the suburbs, on safari -- that we don't realize the scope of our responsibility in this collapse.

Imagine a world without giraffes.

In the long term, without big changes, that's what we reasonably can expect.
