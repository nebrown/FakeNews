Virginia and Villanova were tapped as favorites by one large Nevada sportsbook, minutes after the brackets for March Madness were released Sunday.

William Hill, which runs more than 100 sportsbooks in Nevada, pegged those two No. 1 seeds at 6-to-1 to win it all. Kansas and Xavier – the other two No. 1 seeds – were 10-to-1 and 12-to-1, respectively.

Virginia also has the biggest point spread (22 points) among the 32 first-round games. On Friday, the Cavaliers face the Maryland-Baltimore County Retrievers, who secured a berth with a Jairus Lyles 23-foot last-second shot to win the America East title over the weekend.

Maryland-Baltimore County, Cal State Fullerton, Texas Southern, Radford, LIU-Brooklyn and North Carolina Central are the longshots, each with 2500-to-1 odds to claim the title. 2017 champion North Carolina is listed at 15-to-1 odds to repeat.

Michigan State, which is at 10-to-1, has seen the most money bet on it among all the teams since last year's Final Four concluded with 11% of the future bets placed on the Spartans at William Hill. Ten percent of the future bets during that span have been placed on Duke, which is at 8-to-1 to win a sixth title.
