Canada would view any tariffs on steel or aluminum as unacceptable and will take appropriate measures to defend workers and industries if needed, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Monday.

The latest trade deal talks with her Mexican and US counterparts have ended in Mexico City with little success.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has told President Donald Trump tariffs will hinder renegotiation of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

Al Jazeera's John Holman has more.

The Trump administration says it plans to let some countries off the hook from steep tariffs on steel and aluminum. But far from soothing fears of a trade war, the exemptions could make the situation worse.

President Donald Trump is expected to formally announce tariffs on US imports of steel and aluminum as early as Thursday.

The administration has signaled that Canada and Mexico will be spared from the measures while they renegotiate NAFTA, the agreement that opens trade among the three countries. The White House has suggested that other countries could also get special treatment.

It's still unclear what final form the plan will take. Experts, business leaders and investors already concerned about Trump's proposed blunt tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are flashing warning signs.

Bush tried this already and it didn't work

Dangling exemptions for Canada and Mexico "undermines" the administration's argument that the tariffs are needed to protect US national security, according to Inu Manak, a visiting scholar at the Cato Institute.

The tariffs are "being used by the president as a bargaining chip," Manak wrote in a blog post Tuesday for the research organization.

Mexico and Canada have been spared from US tariffs on steel in the past.

In 2002, the George W. Bush administration slapped temporary tariffs of up to 30% on all imported steel in an attempt to protect US producers from a deluge of imports.

With Mexico and Canada exempt, their steel exports to the US soared, according to a US government report.

Bush's tariffs didn't last long. The World Trade Organization ruled against the US, which led to a raft of retaliatory sanctions from big trading partners like the European Union. Bush ended up dropping the tariffs in 2003.

The saga was "a good example of the concerted resistance by US trade partners," said John Tang, an economics professor at Australian National University.

Allies may still fight back

Trump is likely to run into similar challenges if he goes ahead with the planned steel and aluminum tariffs.

Bryan Mercurio, a professor of international trade at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, predicts the United States will quickly face cases at the WTO, which it's unlikely to win.

Even countries who are initially exempted from the tariffs may still file trade discrimination cases against the US at the WTO.

They "may not want to establish a precedent and leave the proposed tariffs unchallenged," Tang said.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Wednesday insisted that Trump was showing "a sensible, balanced degree of flexibility" in deciding how to implement the tariffs.

"I think you're going to see, as you understand the details of what actually is going to happen, that we're not trying to blow up the world," Ross said on CNBC.

'Crude implementation'

The possibility of some countries being spared from the tariffs, which Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro had previously insisted wouldn't happen, raises the question of what the administration is trying to achieve with the measures.

"We're talking about a very crude implementation of a very blunt instrument," said Alex Capri, a professor of international trade at the National University of Singapore.

Canada is the biggest exporter of both steel and aluminum to the US by value, while Mexico is the third biggest for steel and in the top 10 for aluminum, according to data for 2017 from Panjiva, a global trade research firm.

If they are both left out, the tariffs would still affect other countries that Trump has accused of playing unfairly on trade, including China.

But the amount of steel and aluminum China sells to the United States is just a fraction of its overall exports of the metals. Chinese steel and aluminum shipments to the United States have already been targeted by previous waves of heavy sanctions.

"The new US tariffs would have little direct impact on China but would mostly harm exports from US allies," Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, wrote in a blog post Wednesday.

Tariffs may be the last thing General Electric needs right now.

GE (GE) makes jet engines, power plant turbines, trains and other heavy machinery that use plenty of steel and aluminum, the two metals that President Trump plans to target for import tariffs.

Deutsche Bank warned in a report Wednesday that the tariffs will jack up GE's costs — and GE may not be able to pass those higher prices on to customers.

GE also makes most of its money overseas, leaving it vulnerable if the tariffs start a trade war.

"We believe GE to be among the most at fundamental risk from rapidly rising steel and aluminum prices," analyst John Inch wrote in the report.

He said GE faces two key risks — higher costs and lost business caused by trade retaliation from other countries.

Inch noted that the trade tensions come as GE grapples with a "depressed" power market and "considerable" earnings and cash pressure.

GE shares slumped nearly 3% on Wednesday and are near their lowest since 2010.

In a statement, GE said that reports on the impact of potential steel and aluminum tariffs on its costs are "completely unfounded."

"Our internal data shows our consumption of imported metals likely to be impacted by the tariffs is minimal," GE said. "We are monitoring the situation as it develops."

A GE spokeswoman said that the company's assessment is based on the Commerce Department's recommendation of a range of trade actions for Trump. The president has said he wants to impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% levy on aluminum. A final announcement is expected later this week.

GE has long been a champion of free trade. It's the quintessential multinational company, with operations in more than 180 countries and more than 60% of its sales coming from overseas.

"We disfavor barriers to trade, investment and the movement of people," GE CEO John Flannery wrote in his annual shareholder released last month.

"GE will continue to be a strong voice in support of free trade and robust international competition," he wrote.

Deutsche Bank noted that GE produces a wide range of large and expensive equipment made of metals, including steel and aluminum. GE's jet engines can weigh 9,000 pounds. And large locomotives can weigh more than 400,000 pounds.

Steel is already getting more expensive. Benchmark prices for US-made steel have climbed 5% over the past week to the highest level in nearly six years, according to S&P Global Platts.

Related: GE's legal troubles are mounting

Another issue: Some of GE's rivals make most of their products overseas, giving them a cost advantage.

These competitors could "leverage higher US metals pricing to capture market share," said Inch, who started recommending that investors sell GE in May 2017, when the stock was nearly twice as high as today.

Rising costs are unlikely to help GE's effort to sell its rail business, which is mostly based in the United States and uses metals.

Even though the US economy is thriving and the stock market is near record highs, GE has fallen on hard times. Trouble in the power division and years of poor deal-making have sparked a cash crisis that forced GE to halve its dividend last year and lay off thousands of workers.

GE's financial difficulties have been compounded by a mountain of legal problems, including related to subprime mortgages, aggressive accounting tactics and shareholder lawsuits.

Some countries may be exempt from US plans to impose tariffs on metal imports, the White House has announced.

The exemptions - on national security grounds - included Canada and Mexico, spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said.

Reports, however, suggested the apparent softening of the US stance would last for only 30 days.

US President Donald Trump has said steel products will face a 25% tariff, with 10% on aluminium goods. He is expected to sign the plan on Thursday.

Mr Trump tweeted on Thursday morning that he was "looking forward" to a meeting later in the day on the matter.

Skip Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump Looking forward to 3:30 P.M. meeting today at the White House. We have to protect & build our Steel and Aluminum Industries while at the same time showing great flexibility and cooperation toward those that are real friends and treat us fairly on both trade and the military. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 8, 2018 Report

Meanwhile, China threatened an "appropriate and necessary response" in any trade war with the US.

Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China and the US should strive to be partners rather than rivals.

The EU has proposed retaliatory measures against a number of US goods including bourbon and peanut butter.

Despite opposition at home and abroad, Ms Sanders said the US president would sign the measures in by the end of the week.

But she added: "There are potential carve-outs for Mexico and Canada based on national security, and possibly other countries as well based on that process. That would be [on] a case-by-case and country by country basis."

President Trump has previously suggested that planned tariffs for Canada and Mexico could be abandoned if a "new and fair" North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) is signed.

White House trade policy adviser Peter Navarro said on Wednesday that the tariffs would start in 15 to 30 days' time and there would be "a clause that does not impose these tariffs immediately on Canada and Mexico". Both countries knew the president was not "messing around in this", he added.

Why is Mr Trump doing this?

Mr Trump has railed against the US trade deficit, arguing that other countries have been "taking advantage of" the US for decades.

One of his campaign promises was to rebuild the US steel and aluminium industries which he said has suffered "disgraceful" treatment from other countries, in particular cheap Chinese imports.

Skip Twitter post 2 by @realDonaldTrump From Bush 1 to present, our Country has lost more than 55,000 factories, 6,000,000 manufacturing jobs and accumulated Trade Deficits of more than 12 Trillion Dollars. Last year we had a Trade Deficit of almost 800 Billion Dollars. Bad Policies & Leadership. Must WIN again! #MAGA — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 7, 2018 Report

Last week he dismissed concerns he could trigger a trade war, instead saying "trade wars are good" and were something the US would easily win.

Mr Trump has already hinted he could drop plans to impose tariffs on Mexican and Canadian metals but linked it to the US getting a better deal in the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).

Mexico and Canada are among the main suppliers of steel to the US.

What's the reaction been?

The US plans have sparked worldwide alarm and jolted stock markets.

Critics argue that the tariffs would fail to protect American jobs and would ultimately raise prices for consumers.

More than 100 Republicans on Wednesday signed a letter addressed to the president, expressing their "deep concern" about the tariffs.

The letter referenced a sweeping tax cuts bill Congress and the White House worked to pass last year, arguing that "adding new taxes in the form of broad tariffs would undermine the remarkable progress".

International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde warned "nobody wins" in a trade war, saying it would harm global economic growth.

The EU has set out tit-for-tat plans to impose import duties on bourbon, peanut butter, cranberries, orange juice, steel, and industrial products. Other countries are also considering retaliatory steps.

Members of Mr Trump's Republican party are concerned too, with House Speaker Paul Ryan saying he wanted to see tariffs that were "more surgical and more targeted".

Tuesday saw the departure of top White House economic advisor Gary Cohn, who is a strong supporter of free trade.

President Donald Trump is itching for a trade war. No matter what you do for a living, that should scare you.

In a trade war, countries impose tariffs and other barriers on imported products, often in retaliation for actions taken by a trading partner.

That can slow down business activity around the globe by crimping international trade. In a worst case scenario, trade wars can lead to a global depression. Protectionist trade polices are one of the primary factors economists cite for deepening the Great Depression.

So if there's one thing that most economists agree upon, it's no one wins a trade war.

But President Trump doesn't believe that. He tweeted out Friday morning that for the United States, a trade war is "good" and "easy to win."

Here's how US businesses and consumers stand to lose if President Trump gets his wish for a trade war:

Prices will go up

This much is certain. In a trade war, US consumers and businesses will be left with the bill.

President Trump says he's planning to impose a 25% tariff on imported steel and a 10% tariff on imported aluminum. That means the price of cars, appliances, packaged food and everything else that uses steel or aluminum is bound to go up.

Related: Trump's trade fight jolts Wall Street

Even the aluminum industry's trade group admits the smelters remaining in this country cannot make enough additional aluminum to replace the supply coming from overseas. When the tariffs are put in place, imported products will continue to come in -- at higher prices.

Since foreign steel and aluminum prices will be higher, domestic producers are likely to raise their prices as well.

American businesses will lose sales

Yes, America buys more from other countries than it sells to its trading partners. But don't discount the amount of goods and services the United States does export -- $2.3 trillion worth.

A trade war by definition means that other countries are going to slap tariffs and restrictions on those US goods and services, making them more expensive, and less competitive -- if they're allowed into those countries at all.

And once an American business loses a contract to sell its products overseas, it can take a long time to win that business back. Their customers will find other, perhaps more dependable suppliers while the trade war is waged.

Many well-paying jobs are at risk in a trade war. In 2017, the United States exported $60 billion worth of auto parts, $56 billion of civilian aircraft, $52 billion of new cars and trucks, and $51 billion of pharmaceuticals.

Related: Why steel and aluminum tariffs matter to the U.S. economy

That's only goods. The United States has been primarily a service economy for decades now. Today about five times as many jobs are in the service sector, such as finance, media, transportation and retail, than are in goods producing sectors, such as manufacturing and mining.

The good news is that the United States had a $243 billion services trade surplus.

American trading partners are also among its biggest lenders

The federal deficit is big and getting bigger. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the deficit could swell to $1 trillion by next year.

Wall Street worries that the rising amount of debt could drive up the interest rates on the government debt, since the Treasury Department will have to offer higher rates to borrow more money. That would increase the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses, since many types of loans -- including mortgages -- track government bond rates.

One thing keeping rates in check so far is the demand for US debt from overseas. America's foreign trading partners, including China, are among the largest buyers of that debt. It added $127 billion to its holdings last year and now owns more than $1 trillion in U.S. debt, making it the largest foreign holder of our debt.

The trade deficit that President Trump decries is one of the reasons for those holdings. It gives foreign countries a powerful incentive to buy that debt, since they have to do something with the dollars they get back on those sales.

If the trade gap shrinks, for whatever reason, China won't have as much incentive to buy US debt, and interest rates could rise significantly.

WASHINGTON (AP) — After a week of hints and uncertainty, President Donald Trump said Thursday he would announce tariffs on imported steel and aluminum but with temporary exemptions for Canada and Mexico as he seeks to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement. He suggested Australia and "other countries" might also be spared, a shift that could soften the international blow amid threats of retaliation by trading partners.

Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports will take effect in 15 days, with Canada and Mexico indefinitely exempted from the duties, according to people outside the White House who were briefed on the plans Thursday. The people spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of the president's signing of the orders.

"We're going to be very fair, we're going to be very flexible but we're going to protect the American worker as I said I would do in my campaign," Trump said during a Cabinet meeting.

The president reiterated that he would levy tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum but would "have a right to go up or down depending on the country and I'll have a right to drop out countries or add countries. I just want fairness."

The president indicated Canada and Mexico's treatment would be connected to the ongoing NAFTA talks, which are expected to resume in early April.

The people briefed on the plans said all countries affected by the tariffs would be invited to negotiate with the Trump administration to be exempted from the tariffs if they can address the threat their exports pose to U.S. manufacturers. The people said the exclusions for Canada and Mexico could be ended if talks to renegotiate NAFTA stall.

The process of announcing the penalties has been the subject of an intense debate and chaotic exchanges within the White House, pitting hard-liners against free trade advocates such as outgoing economic adviser Gary Cohn aiming to add more flexibility for U.S. trading partners.

The fight over tariffs comes amid intense turmoil in the West Wing, which has seen waves of departures and negative news stories that have left Trump increasingly isolated in the Oval Office, according to two senior officials speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking. Trump was still hearing last-minute pleas from opponents of the tariff plan, and White House officials said they couldn't predict how the day would shake out.

Steel and aluminum workers were invited to the White House for the afternoon announcement with Trump.

Peter Navarro, Trump's trade and manufacturing adviser, said in an interview on Fox Business on Wednesday that the tariffs would go into effect within about 15 to 30 days and that the proclamation signed by the president would include a clause that would not immediately impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico.

Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters the exemptions would be made on a "case by case" and "country by country" basis, a reversal from the policy articulated by the White House just days ago that there would be no exemptions from Trump's plan.

Congressional Republicans and business groups are bracing for the impact of the tariffs, appearing resigned to additional protectionist trade actions as Trump signals upcoming economic battles with China.

The looming departure of Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive who has opposed the promised tariffs, set off anxiety among business leaders and investors worried about a potential trade war.

"We urge you to reconsider the idea of broad tariffs to avoid unintended negative consequences to the U.S. economy and its workers," 107 House Republicans wrote in a letter to Trump.

At the White House, officials were working to include language in the tariffs that would give Trump the flexibility to approve exemptions for certain countries.

"He's already indicated a degree of flexibility, I think a very sensible, very balanced degree of flexibility," Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told CNBC. "We're not trying to blow up the world."

Trump signaled other trade actions could be in the works. In a tweet, he said the "U.S. is acting swiftly on Intellectual Property theft." A White House official said Trump was referencing an ongoing investigation of China in which the U.S. trade representative is studying whether Chinese intellectual property rules are "unreasonable or discriminatory" to American business.

The official, who was not authorized to discuss internal deliberations and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said an announcement on the findings of the report — and possible retaliatory actions — was expected within the next three weeks.

Business leaders, meanwhile, continued to sound the alarm about the potential economic fallout from tariffs, with the president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce raising the specter of a global trade war. That scenario, Tom Donohue said, would endanger the economic momentum from the GOP tax cuts and Trump's rollback of regulations.

"We urge the administration to take this risk seriously," Donohue said.

The president has said the tariffs are needed to reinforce lagging American steel and aluminum industries and protect national security. He has tried to use the tariffs as leverage in ongoing talks to renegotiate NAFTA, suggesting Canada and Mexico might be exempted from tariffs if they offer more favorable terms under the trade agreement.

President Trump is signing an order Thursday that imposes tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from all foreign countries, while carving out an exception for Canada and Mexico for now while NAFTA negotiations are underway, White House officials told Fox News.

The administration is placing a 25 percent tariff on all steel, and 10 percent on aluminum across the board.

“We have to protect & build our Steel and Aluminum Industries while at the same time showing great flexibility and cooperation toward those that are real friends and treat us fairly on both trade and the military,” the president tweeted early Thursday.

Officials said this week that Mexico and Canada would be exempt from the tariffs during the American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, talks. The president himself has hinted at other exemptions.

“If that [NAFTA] negotiation is unsuccessful then tariffs will be applied across the board,” Peter Navarro, Director of the White House National Trade Council told Fox News. “Now, importantly, in addition to that, there is language that will allow other countries to effectively propose ways that they could get a similar dispensation in exchange for more fair and reciprocal trade with the United States.”

But the 25 percent and 10 percent should not be seen as firm. Navarro said that if Canada, Mexico, or any other country is eventually granted an exemption, then tariffs would be raised for all other impacted countries.

And the president, himself, has said the U.S. will be “very fair.”

“[We’re] sticking with 10 and 25 percent initially,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting Thursday. “I’ll have a right to go up or down, depending on the country.”

Trump added, though, “We’re going to be very flexible.”

Navarro told Fox News that the president was not using the tariffs as a “bargaining chip,” but noted that “any country that is allowed to be removed from the tariffs would result in higher tariffs for everybody else.”

“So we still maintain a level of protection in defense of the aluminum and steel industries,” Navarro said.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters Wednesday that the exemptions would be made on a “case by case” and “country by country” basis—a shift from the White House’s initial policy introduced last week. The move could soften retaliation from trading partners and warnings from lawmakers and business groups.

Fox News' Adam Shaw, John Roberts, Kristin Brown and Serafin Gomez contributed to this report.

The United States is an exporting powerhouse, but you wouldn't know it given how much President Donald Trump complains about imports and trade gaps.

Yes, the nation's businesses and consumers spent $566 billion more on imported goods and services in 2017 than the United States sold in exports. But American companies still sold $2.3 trillion in goods and services to foreign businesses and consumers.

Some trading partners have threatened to take action against American products in retaliation for President Trump's proposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Europe said it may impose tariffs on Harley-Davidson (HOG) motorcycles and Kentucky bourbon. Brazil is threatening to cut back on purchases of U.S. coal.

Those may be high-profile products, but none are big US exports.

Related: A Trump trade war would hit red states hard

For example, Harley-Davidson sold about 45,000 motorcycles in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in 2017. All those bikes cost as much as a few of Dreamliner passenger jets from Boeing.

Top U.S. goods exports

Here's a breakdown of the biggest U.S. export industries in 2017, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.

Food, beverage and feed: $133 billion. Soybeans were the number one product in this category, with sales of $22 billion, followed by meat and poultry at $18 billion.

Crude oil, fuel and other petroleum products: $109 billion. This is one of the fastest growing areas of US exports, up 37% in just the last year.

Civilian aircraft and aircraft engines: $99 billion. This is what makes Boeing (BA) the nation's largest single exporter.

Auto parts, engines and car tires: $86 billion. Many of these are shipped to assembly plants owned by both US and foreign automakers in Mexico and Canada. It's one of the reasons losing NAFTA would be so hard for the auto industry.

Industrial machines: $57 billion.

Passenger cars: $53 billion. American auto plants supply much of North and South America with cars, and also ship to other markets as well. BMW's largest plant is in South Carolina, where it builds all of its X series SUVs. Last year it exported nearly three-quarters of the 371,000 cars it built there, making it the biggest car exporter in the United States.

Pharmaceuticals: $51 billion.

Top U.S. service exports

But the goods that the United States exports only tell part of the story. Services are the biggest US export, with total foreign sales of $778 billion last year. Indeed, the United States has a $243 billion trade surplus in services, which is good news since service industries account for 71% of US jobs.

These are the service industries that bring in the most money:

Travel and transportation: $236 billion.

Finance and insurance: $76 billion.

Sales from intellectual property: $49 billion. This includes software, movies and television shows.

Europe's most powerful banker says America's decision to go it alone on trade could trigger retaliation, damage confidence and hurt the global economy.

"Unilateral decisions are dangerous," said Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, on Thursday. "We are convinced that disputes should be discussed and resolved in a multilateral framework," he told reporters.

Draghi was speaking just hours before President Donald Trump was expected to formalize tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum, a decision he has justified in the name of national security.

The central banker did not call out the US president by name, but he was responding to a question about the risk Trump's tariffs posed to the European economy.

He said that unilateral trade actions raised questions "about the state of international relations."

"If you put tariffs against what are your allies, one wonders who the enemies are?" he asked.

Trump has said that the new tariffs would apply to all countries. But members of his administration have suggested there could be exemptions for Canada and Mexico, and perhaps some other countries too.

Related: Why sparing some countries could make trade chaos worse

Draghi said the immediate economic impact of the tariffs would be small.

He cautioned, however, that retaliation by other countries would result in a bigger hit to the economy, and potentially drive up the value of the dollar.

"Whenever there was a threat of putting tariffs toward another country, it was the dollar that would appreciate," he said. "But things can be different from time to time."

A stronger dollar could make life harder for US exporters.

Related: What is a trade war? And all your other questions, answered

The central bank chief said the most important risk from Trump's tariffs would be a loss of confidence.

"The effect on confidence is very difficult to assess, estimate, forecast, but if it's a negative effect on confidence that is going to be negative on both inflation and output," he said.

The ECB held its key interest rate steady on Thursday. But it hinted that it was considering how to end its stimulus program, under which it has purchased bonds worth over €2 trillion ($2.5 trillion).

When his turn came to question Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin during a House Appropriations Committee hearing on Tuesday, Congressman David Young relayed a concern he'd just heard from a farmer in the hallway.

"He says, 'There's not a day on the farm when a farmer doesn't touch steel,'" the Republican from Iowa told Mnuchin. "The agriculture industry is worried about these tariffs on aluminum and steel. How much do you know about the proposed tariffs?"

"I know a lot about the proposed tariffs," Mnuchin answered. "And I can tell you the president loves farmers and the agricultural community."

"It doesn't seem so with some of the policies that are coming out," Young shot back. "There's great concern with folks in the heartland, and concern as well with retaliation and what that may mean to the economy."

Mnuchin received a lot of criticism that day — even from members of his own party. While farm-state conservatives praised Trump's tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks, they didn't hold back when it came to their disapproval of a tariff tit-for-tat.

They have reason to be concerned. Historically, agricultural products take a hit when the US targets imports of industrial goods. Other countries have imposed countermeasures like tariffs on US goods and sometimes outright bans that have depressed sales.

The same thing may happen again if Trump carries through with his promise to impose tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum.

In response to what it refers to as this "deeply unjust" plan, the European Union has said it is considering new tariffs on American products ranging from cranberries to peanut butter.

Related: Why steel and aluminum tariffs matter to the U.S. economy

This is a familiar pattern. In 1995, for example, the United States banned Mexican trucks from driving more than a short distance over the border, after it had agreed to let them do so under the North American Free Trade Agreement. In 2009, following a drawn-out protest, Mexico retaliated with hefty tariffs on scores of food items, from ketchup to frozen corn.

The United States eventually lifted its ban on trucks in 2011, and Mexico dropped the tariffs. But the damage had been done: A study later found that the retaliation decreased sales of those products to Mexico by 22%, or nearly a billion dollars.

And already in the Trump administration, China has announced an investigation into American sorghum imports after the United States imposed tariffs on Chinese washing machines and solar panels. The United States sold nearly a billion dollars worth of the grain to China in 2017. Should China choose to impose duties on those exports, US farmers could be forced to cut prices in order to attract another buyer for their supply.

"This indicates to me a very real-world example that tariffs on those washing machines and solar panels led to retaliation, to the detriment of American farmers, constituents of the President and mine," said Kevin Yoder, a Republican from Kansas, during Tuesday's hearing with Mnuchin. "Is the president aware that these retaliatory tariffs are already occurring?"

Yoder's home state of Kansas accounts for nearly half of US sorghum production.

Why do American farmers so often get tangled up in trade wars? For one thing, they already have access to many world markets. In places where the US has negotiated trade agreements, they face low or no tariffs. US farmers have also been prodigious exporters: While the United States runs a $566 billion trade deficit with the rest of the world overall, it has a trade surplus of $21 billion in agriculture.

With so much going their way, farmers don't want to upset the international trade apple cart.

"There's nothing to win," said Daniel Sumner, an agricultural economics professor at University of California, Davis. "There's only stuff to lose."

The United States' trading partners know that farm products are a good way to squeeze a politically powerful constituency, particularly for Republicans. To wield influence, countries may target US products they can get elsewhere, like wine from Chile or soybeans from Brazil.

"We want to get your attention so you'll change your policy," Sumner said of countries that want the administration to abandon the steel and aluminum tariffs. "So you've got to get an industry that will be hurt enough to talk to their representatives."

Agricultural margins have already been shrinking over the years. Global commodity prices have sagged and the United States' longstanding subsidy and insurance programs for certain crops have become less generous.

A new threat came from President Trump's opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement. The trade deal may have hurt some US manufacturers, but it was a boon to the agriculture sector, which has become highly mechanized and is therefore less dependent on cheap labor than products like cars, for example.

Two separate lobbying groups, Americans for Farmers & Families and Farmers for Free Trade, which is co-chaired by retired senators Dick Lugar and Max Baucus, have formed in the past few months to advocate for preserving NAFTA.

"Farm country is Trump country," said Matt McAlvanah, a former spokesman for the US Trade Representative in the Obama administration who now represents Farmers for Free Trade. "Our engagement is more important than ever right now."

To head off the damaging tariffs, the groups have been seeking the support of lawmakers who aren't from farm states, and working with governors like Arkansas' Asa Hutchinson to declare Agricultural Trade Awareness days.

It may be working: After initially declaring that the tariffs would apply to all countries, the White House is now saying Canada and Mexico could be exempt if a new NAFTA deal is reached.

Meanwhile, American farmers are losing out in a more subtle way. The Asian and South American countries that were part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal before Trump pulled out of it are about to sign the pact without the United States. That will create more favorable treatment for agricultural products like potatoes within the bloc, according to the USDA, disadvantaging US growers.

Although none of this has happened yet, Sumner said that the uncertainty chills investment in crops that take a long time to bear fruit.

"If I plant a walnut orchard, I'm looking to the next two to three decades," Sumner said. "If it's a crop that depends on exports, and you disrupt the potential for exports, that's a problem."

Tesla CEO Elon Musk wants his electric car company to be competitive in China, and he's asking for President Trump's help.

After Trump jotted off a tweet about America's "massive" trade deficit with China, Musk responded with a question: "Do you think the US & China should have equal & fair rules for cars?"

He said all Tesla (TSLA) vehicles shipped to China face a 25% import tax while a "Chinese car coming to the US only pays 2.5%, a tenfold difference."

"I am against import duties in general, but the current rules make things very difficult. It's like competing in an Olympic race wearing lead shoes," Musk wrote.

We raised this with the prior administration and nothing happened. Just want a fair outcome, ideally where tariffs/rules are equally moderate. Nothing more. Hope this does not seem unreasonable. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 8, 2018

"We raised this with the prior administration and nothing happened," he added. "Just want a fair outcome, ideally where tariffs/rules are equally moderate. Nothing more. Hope this does not seem unreasonable," another tweet said.

The Twitter exchange came one week after Trump announced plans to slap a 25% tariff on steel and a 10% tariff on aluminum, sparking fears of a trade war.

Trump Administration officials said that policy could become official this week. An announcement is expected Thursday afternoon.

President Donald Trump's top economic adviser has resigned after clashing with the president over planned tariffs on steel and aluminium.

Gary Cohn's departure is the latest in a long string of departures. Cohn is expected to leave in a matter of weeks, the White House has confirmed on Tuesday.

Cohn, a free trade proponent and Goldman Sachs veteran, had been counselling the president against his proposal to impose a 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminium imports.

Cohn was critical of Trump's singular, major legislative victory, playing a central role in the development of the Republican tax overhaul.

Trump's tariff plan has raised widespread concern about sparking trade wars with the US' trading partners, including from Cohn and the president's allies on Capitol Hill.

Trump response

Following the critics' narrative that the White House is in continued chaos, Trump denied the criticism as "fake news", saying on Twitter that "people will always come & go.

"I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos, only great Energy!" he said.

The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House. Wrong! People will always come & go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos, only great Energy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 6, 2018

Voicing gratitude

After Cohn's departure was made public, Trump struck a thankful tone, saying he "did a superb job".

"Gary has been my chief economic advisor and did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping to deliver historic tax cuts and reforms and unleashing the American economy once again. He is a rare talent, and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people," Trump said in a statement.

Cohn voiced his gratitude to the president in a statement issued by the White House.

"It has been an honor to serve my country and enact pro-growth economic policies to benefit the American people, in particular the passage of historic tax reform. I am grateful to the President for giving me this opportunity and wish him and the Administration great success in the future," Cohn said.

US President Donald Trump is considering attending the opening of the American embassy in Jerusalem in May.

It is a controversial move that could further inflame tensions over peace negotiations with Palestine.

Trump has been holding talks with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House - their fifth meeting in a year.
