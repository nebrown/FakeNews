WASHINGTON, 8 mar (Reuters) - Las exportaciones de soja estadounidenses enfrentarán una mayor competencia de Brasil, uno de los principales productores globales de la oleaginosa, mientras que las existencias finales de maíz de Estados Unidos serán menores a lo anticipado en 2017/2018, dijo el jueves la agencia gubernamental USDA.

En su reporte mensual sobre la oferta mundial de granos, el Departamento de Agricultura estadounidense (USDA por sus siglas en inglés) elevó su proyección para la cosecha de soja de Brasil en el ciclo 2017/2018 en 1 millón de toneladas y aumentó su cálculo de las exportaciones del país sudamericano en 1,5 millones de toneladas.

Además, la agencia redujo su estimación para la cosecha de soja argentina en 7 millones de toneladas y recortó la previsión para la producción de maíz argentina en 3 millones de toneladas, debido a las condiciones de clima seco que han afectado el rendimiento de los cultivos.

El USDA también incrementó sus proyecciones sobre las existencias finales de trigo, ya que los suministros estadounidenses presentaron precios demasiado elevados como para competir en el mercado de exportaciones.

El Gobierno indicó que las existencias finales de maíz de Estados Unidos llegarían a 2.127 millones de bushels en la actual temporada, un declive respecto a la estimación del mes anterior de 2.352 millones de bushels y por debajo de las previsiones del mercado en un sondeo de Reuters de un rango entre 2.240 millones y 2.352 millones de bushels.

USDA aumentó sus previsiones de exportaciones de maíz estadounidense en 175 millones de bushels a 2.225 millones de bushels. Además, subió su previsión del cereal usado para elaborar etanol a 5.575 millones de bushels, desde 5.525 millones de bushels.

Las existencias finales de soja de Estados Unidos se ubicarían en 555 millones de bushels, por encima de las previsiones de marzo. Las estimaciones promedio de los analistas en un sondeo de Reuters apuntaban a inventarios finales de 530 millones de bushels en el país norteamericano.

La agencia gubernamental también rebajó su cálculo de exportaciones de soja estadounidense a 2.065 millones de bushels, desde 2.100 millones de bushels.

Las existencias finales estadounidenses de trigo llegarían a 1.034 millones de bushels, un alza respecto a los 1.009 millones de bushels previstos el mes anterior. USDA disminuyó su previsión sobre las exportaciones de trigo del país a 925 millones de bushels, desde 950 millones de bushels.

En Argentina, la proyección sobre la cosecha de maíz fue reducida a 36 millones de toneladas y la de soja también bajó a 47 millones de toneladas, de acuerdo al reporte del Gobierno estadounidense. La cosecha de soja de Brasil, en tanto, subiría a 113 millones de toneladas y su producción de maíz llegaría a 94,5 millones de toneladas, añadió.

BUENOS AIRES, 8 mar (Reuters) - La Bolsa de Cereales de Buenos Aires (BCBA) redujo el jueves sus previsiones para las cosechas de soja y maíz 2017/18 de Argentina a 42 millones y 34 millones de toneladas, respectivamente, debido a los efectos de la sequía que continúa afectando al país sudamericano.

La semana pasada la BCBA había calculado la producción de la oleaginosa y el cereal, los dos principales cultivos de Argentina, en 44 millones y 37 millones de toneladas, respectivamente.

Como consecuencia de la sequía, la Bolsa ha reducido en reiteradas oportunidades sus cálculos para la cosecha de soja y maíz, cuyas estimaciones iniciales habían sido de 54 millones y 41 millones de toneladas respectivamente, lo que a su vez ha impulsado a los valores de los futuros en el mercado de Chicago.

“Se prolonga la sequía y además de importantes mermas en los rendimientos previstos a la cosecha (de la soja), se suma el incremento en pérdidas de superficie que ya supera las 700 mil hectáreas”, cerca del 4 por ciento de los 18 millones de hectáreas dedicados a la oleaginosa, dijo la BCBA.

Con respecto al maíz, la entidad señaló que muchos lotes sembrados de manera tardía atraviesan fases clave de desarrollo con condiciones de humedad inadecuadas.

“La falta de precipitaciones registradas durante las últimas semanas disminuyó el potencial de rinde de estos cuadros, impactando en la proyección de producción”, explicó la Bolsa en su reporte semanal de cultivos.

Hasta el miércoles, los productores habían recolectado el 6,5 por ciento del área cosechable de los 5,4 millones de hectáreas que se sembraron con maíz de uso comercial, según el informe de la entidad.

A su vez, la Bolsa dijo que, debido a la más reciente ausencia de lluvias en las provincias del norte del país, podría realizar más recortes en las estimaciones de cosecha de la soja y el maíz. (Reporte de Maximilian Heath, Editado por Juliana Castilla)

Bones discovered on a Pacific island in 1940 "likely" belonged to famed pilot Amelia Earhart, according to a US peer reviewed science journal.

Earhart, her plane, and her navigator vanished without a trace in 1937 over the Pacific Ocean. Many theories have sought to explain her disappearance.

But a new study published in Forensic Anthropology claims these bones prove she died as an island castaway.

The report claims they are a 99% match, despite an earlier conclusion.

The study, titled Amelia Earhart and the Nikumaroro Bones, was first published by the University of Florida and conducted by Professor Richard Jantz from the University of Tennessee.

It disputes that the remains found on the eastern Pacific island of Nikumaroro - about 1,800 miles (2,900km) southwest of Hawaii - belonged to a man, as a researcher had determined in 1941.

Earhart was known to have been near the island when she vanished during her doomed attempt to fly across the globe.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Earhart was perhaps the most famous woman in the world when she vanished

A British party exploring the island for habitation in 1940 found a human skull, a woman's shoe, a Navy tool used by her navigator Fred Noonan (who also vanished), and a bottle of the herbal liqueur Benedictine - "something Earhart was known to carry".

"There was suspicion at the time that the bones could be the remains of Amelia Earhart," Dr Jantz wrote in the study.

The party found a total of 13 bones, which were then sent to Fiji to be analysed by Dr D W Hoodless, who concluded that they had belonged to a male.

But Dr Jantz argues that because forensic osteology - the study of bones - was still in its early stages, Dr Hoodless probably reached a wrong conclusion.

"Forensic anthropology was not well developed in the early 20th century," the paper states.

Consulting Dr Hoodless' measurements of the bones, Dr Jantz used Fordisc, a modern computer programme now widely used by forensic anthropologists, to compare them to Earhart's height and body stature.

The bones have unfortunately since been lost, and so cannot be analysed.

But the research team used historical photographs, as well as her pilots and drivers licences, to determine that her body proportions matched the skeletal remains.

A "historical seamstress" was also consulted to analyse her clothing, including "the inseam length and waist circumference of Earhart's trousers".

"This analysis reveals that Earhart is more similar to the Nikumaroro bones than 99% of individuals in a large reference sample," the report states.

The research found the remains belonged to a woman of taller-than-average European descent, as Earhart was.

"This strongly supports the conclusion that the Nikumaroro bones belonged to Amelia Earhart."

"Until definitive evidence is presented that the remains are not those of Amelia Earhart," Dr Jantz writes in the paper, "the most convincing argument is that they are hers."

Earhart was the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean, and was considered one of the most famous women in the world when the mystery of her disappearance began.

She is still frequently honoured as a pioneer of women's empowerment, and was recently chosen by Mattel to be depicted as a Barbie doll.

US pilot Amelia Earhart was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic in 1932, and set a number of other aviation records.

She disappeared with her navigator, Captain Fred Noonan, in 1937 over the Pacific Ocean during an attempt to fly around the globe.

Earhart was born in Kansas in 1897. She started learning to fly some 24 years later.

A crowd cheered as she boarded her single-engine Lockheed Vega airplane in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, for a trip to London on 22 May 1932.

Earhart and Noonan first tried to fly around the would in 1924 - their plane is seen here over the Golden Gate Bridge near San Francisco. The trip had to be abandoned after the plane crashed on take-off in Hawaii.

New Research Claims Bones Found 80 Years Ago On Pacific Atoll Likely Amelia Earhart's

There is no shortage of speculation on what became of legendary American aviator Amelia Earhart, who disappeared in 1937 over the Pacific during an attempt to circumnavigate the globe by air.

Now, Richard Jantz, a researcher affiliated with the University of Tennessee, has reexamined data from bones found three years after Earhart vanished on a remote atoll and determined they very likely belonged to her.

Three main theories about Earhart's disappearance — arguably the most enduring aviation mystery in history — have been bandied about over the years.

The first (and simplest) is that Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan, flying their Lockheed Electra 10E, simply ran out of fuel and crashed into the vast Pacific Ocean short of Howland Island, where they were expected to land.

Another theory has it that Earhart (and possibly Noonan) survived a crash landing and that at least she was taken prisoner by Japanese forces, who were expanding their reach in the region in the lead up to World War II.

Yet another one is that the Lockheed Electra crashed on or near Nikumaroro Island, about 400 miles south of Howland, probably as a result of a navigation error. Nikumaroro (then known as Gardener Island), is a tiny coral ring that is part of the current day Republic of Kirabati.

It is this last theory that the new analysis by Jantz, a professor emeritus of anthropology and director emeritus of UT's Forensic Anthropology Center, supports.

He took a closer look at data gathered in 1940 from skeletal remains recovered by a British expedition to Nikumaroro. The British found a human skull, humeri and radii (both arm bones), a tibia and fibula from the lower leg and two femurs (thigh bones). The bones were sent to Fiji, where they were examined and measured in 1941 by physician D.W. Hoodless.

But the bones themselves are long gone. After Hoodless examined them, and determining them to be from a stocky, European male, they disappeared. The assumption is that either he or someone else in Fiji discarded them.

Jantz, working with the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR), which has been big into Earhart research for years, ran the measurements taken by Hoodless 80 years ago through Fordisc, "a computer program for estimating sex, ancestry, and stature from skeletal measurements," according to a statement from the University of Tennessee Knoxville.

The analysis "found that Hoodless had incorrectly determined the sex of the remains. [Fordisc], co-created by Jantz, is used by nearly every board-certified forensic anthropologist in the US and around the world."

"The data revealed that the bones have more similarity to Earhart than to 99 percent of individuals in a large reference sample," the statement said.

NPR's Christopher Joyce reported on All Things Considered back in 1998 about a similar but presumably less sophisticated analysis that determined the bones were in fact female.

"Hoodless had 13 bones to work with, including the skull and some long bones from the legs and arms," Christopher reported at the time. "His conclusion, was that the bones belonged to a European, but a European male," and that they were about 5'6" — shorter than Earhart's 5'9".

Using "scaleable objects" in photos of Earhart and examination of the inseam of some of her trousers found in archives, Jantz and another forensic analyst, Jeff Glickman, determined that Earhart was a bit shorter than that — 5'7" or 5'8". Her pilot's license also apparently lists Earhart as 5'7". In photographs of Earhart and Noonan, he stands several inches taller than her.

To determine the height of the person whose skeletal remains were examined, Jantz compared the ratio of the humerus to the radius, which came out to 0.756. The average for a mid-20th century female was 0.73, but Earhart was a bit taller than average. From the photo analysis, Glickman says Earhart's ratio should have been 0.76.

However, that all depends on a few things: Were the measurements taken by Hoodless accurate? (And if, as we speculate, Hoodless didn't know the potential historical import of the remains, how carefully were they taken?). And how accurate was the photo analysis? Even a small variation might put the calculations off.

If we still had the bones, that might clear things up. So, why would Hoodless have thrown them out?

In 1929 the SS Norwich City, an English steamer, had wrecked off the coast of Gardner Island with the loss of 11 of the vessel's crew of 35. Hoodless might have thought he was looking at remains from that shipwreck. (Jantz says he's ruled out the remains in his analysis could be any of the shipwrecked sailors).

It might also be true that in 1940 the prevailing theory of Earhart's disappearance was probably the one where her plane ran out of fuel just short of Howland and crashed into the open ocean. In any case, that was the official explanation being offered by the U.S. government. This would seem to give further weight to the notion that Hoodless probably did not think he was looking at anything of historical import.

"When Hoodless conducted his analysis, forensic osteology was not yet a well-developed discipline," Jantz explains in the published research in the journal Forensic Anthropology. "Evaluating his methods with reference to modern data and methods suggests that they were inadequate to his task; this is particularly the case with his sexing method. Therefore his sex assessment of the Nikumaroro bones cannot be assumed to be correct."

Even so, Jantz acknowledges that a 2015 study found the techniques employed by Hoodless were "sound and therefore his sex estimate was likely correct."

British police announced Thursday that 21 people were being treated after a former Russian spy and his daughter were poisoned with a nerve agent.

Kier Pritchard, the acting chief constable of Wiltshire Police, said a "total of 21 people are being treated as a result of the ex-Russian spy poisoning," Sky News reported.

"Multiple people have been treated, around 21 people, including the man and woman found on the bench," Pritchard said. "A number of those have been through the hospital treatment process, they are having blood tests, support and advice."

Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were found unconscious on a bench in the English city of Salisbury Sunday after being poisoned with a “very rare” nerve agent.

A source told the BBC the nerve agent used is thought to be rarer than Sarin gas.

A police officer, who was identified as Nick Bailey, also became ill after treating the father and daughter. Bailey is in serious but stable condition. Rudd said the officer is “talking and engaging.” She said it is highly likely the officer was exposed to the same nerve agent.

Pritchard said only Skripal, his daughter and Bailey are the only ones currently in the hospital.

Rudd said the attack is an "outrageous crime" and a "brazen and reckless act" but cautions it is too early to say who was behind it.

Rudd told the BBC that enormous resources are being directed at trying to figure out who might be responsible for the poisoning of Skripal and his daughter.

EX-RUSSIAN SPY, DAUGHTER REMAIN IN CRITICAL CONDITION AS UK LAWMAKERS PROBE POSSIBLE KREMLIN LINK

The Skripal case is reminiscent of the 2006 killing of another former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned in London with radioactive polonium-210.

A British inquiry into Litvinenko’s death found that Russian agents poisoned him by lacing his tea with radioactive polonium-210 and that the killing was probably approved by President Vladimir Putin. Russia has denied any involvement in Litvinenko's death, and this week said it wasn't involved in Skripal's collapse.

Authorities do not believe the same nerve agent was used in the attack on Skripal and his daughter.

Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told lawmakers Tuesday that if Moscow is shown to have been involved in the Skripal case, the government would act — possibly downgrading England's participation in this year's soccer World Cup in Russia. Johnson warned British officials may not be involved in the sporting event "in the normal way," but did not elaborate.

The BBC reported the investigation could take weeks before the government confirms any Russian involvement.

Skripal served with Russia's military intelligence, often known by its Russian-language acronym GRU, and retired in 1999. He then worked at the Foreign Ministry until 2003 and later became involved in business.

EX-RUSSIAN SPY, DAUGHTER POISONED BY NERVE AGENT IN ‘TARGETED’ ACT, BRITISH AUTHORITIES SAY

Skripal was convicted in 2006 in Russia on charges of spying for Britain and sentenced to 13 years, but was freed in 2010 in a U.S.-Russian spy swap.

Following his arrest in Moscow in December 2004, Skripal confessed to having been recruited by British special services in 1995 and feeding them information about Russian agents in Europe, receiving more than $100,000 for his services.

Skripal, whose wife and son died in recent years, reportedly told police before the incident that he feared for his life. He also reportedly told police that he believed he was poisoned.

Witnesses told the BBC Skripal acted “very strange” and “very agitated” moments before he was found unconscious on the bench. The former spy was seen “screaming at the top of his voice” for the check at Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday.

Wearing a sheriff’s uniform with what appeared to be a gun strapped to his belt, the 14-year-old boy walked up to a Victorville home and told the resident he was investigating a report of a domestic disturbance.

After a brief exchange in which the homeowner told him there was no problem, the teen left.

Victorville police detectives learned that the suspect also initiated two other similar contacts Monday night, posing as a law enforcement officer. The boy, a probationer who was not named because of his age, was arrested Tuesday and booked at the High Desert Juvenile Detention Center.

The first incident occurred about 6 p.m. in the 13600 block of Mica Avenue. The teen, who was driving his great grandparent’s Ford Explorer, pulled into the driveway with red and blue emergency lights flashing, authorities said.

He wore a San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department uniform when he spoke with the homeowner. The resident reported the encounter to police.

Later that night, the teen allegedly stopped a woman on the road, took her information and let her go with a warning, police said. Authorities said he also pulled into another driveway, where he told a resident that he was investigating a disturbance call.

Detectives are still trying to find the latter two victims. Anyone with information can call Victorville police at (760) 241-2911.

A 14-year-old California boy has been arrested for allegedly posing as a sheriff's deputy while driving a car with emergency lights, police say.

The teenager allegedly pulled over a car, and after "obtaining the female's information he gave her a warning and let her go", California police said.

He also allegedly visited two homes, claiming to be responding to a domestic disturbance call.

He was later detained while driving a vehicle owned by his great grandmother.

The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said the teenager, who has not been identified due to his age, had mounted red and blue flashing lights to the windscreen of his great-grandmother's Ford Explorer SUV and wore what appeared to be a real handgun.

He was arrested on Tuesday at the High Desert Juvenile Detention Center, according to the Victorville Police Department.

In addition to stopping at least one driver on Monday night, the boy also allegedly visited a home and told its owner he there to investigate a "reported domestic disturbance," according to a police press release.

The boy was told there had been no call, and then tried to open the locked door after homeowner had closed it on him, according to police.

"For me, I was like, 'That's not normal. Do cops do that?'" Jasmine Jones, who lives at the residence, told KTLA-News.

"I saw the police uniform and I thought, 'That just doesn't look right,'" she said.

"It's loose, and the belt buckle isn't staying on his hips."

He also allegedly visited another home and activated his lights, causing a 16-year-old boy to leave his home.

He again claimed to be investigating a domestic disturbance and left after being informed there had not been a call, police said.

During a later search of the boy's home, investigators said they discovered a San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department uniform he allegedly wore.

Detectives also found "a large amount of counterfeit money, simulations firearms, ballistic vests, and other law enforcement related items".

The boy was already on probation, and has now been booked into the High Desert Juvenile Detention Center.

Update: British police now say a total of roughly 21 people have sought treatment after a nerve agent was used to attack an ex-Russian spy and his daughter.

Wiltshire acting police chief Kier Pritchard told Sky News on Thursday that "a number" of those people got blood tests, support and hospital advice. He says only three people remain hospitalized.

They are former double agent Sergei Skripal, his daughter Yulia and police Sgt. Nick Bailey. Officials say Bailey is making progress. The ex-spy and his daughter remain in critical condition. Police say the roughly 21 people treated include the three still hospitalized.

Previous report:

LONDON — Whoever attacked a former Russian spy with a rare nerve agent is guilty of a "brazen and reckless act," and Britain's government will act on it without hesitation when it becomes clear who is responsible, the minister in charge of domestic security said on Thursday.

British Home Secretary Amber Rudd told the House of Commons that enormous resources are being used to determine who is responsible for poisoning Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia, 33. The pair were found unconscious on a bench in the city of Salisbury on Sunday, triggering a police investigation that is being led by counterterrorism detectives.

"The use of a nerve agent on British soil is a brazen and reckless act," she said. "This was attempted murder in the most cruel and public way. People are right to want to know who to hold to account. But if we are to be rigorous in this investigation we must avoid speculation and allow the police to carry on their investigation."

While police have refused to speculate on who is behind the attack, many have focused on Russia because of the case's similarity to the 2006 killing of another former Russian spy who was poisoned in London with radioactive polonium-210. A public inquiry found that Russia was responsible for the murder of Alexander Litvinenko, and that President Vladimir Putin probably approved it.

Skripal and his daughter are in critical but stable condition at a hospital in Salisbury. A police officer who came to their aid is in a serious but stable condition, though he is conscious and talking, Rudd said.

The Russian government has denied any involvement in the Litvinenko killing or the attempted murder of Skripal, a former Russian agent who had served jail time in his homeland for spying for Britain before being freed in a spy swap.

Rudd said the "government will act without hesitation as the facts become clearer."

In an interview with the BBC, Rudd refused to speculate about what nerve agent may have been used, but she confirmed that it was a "very rare" toxic substance.

The rarity of the material buttresses suggestions that a state actor was involved.

Chemical weapons expert Richard Guthrie of the research project CBW Events, which records the use of chemical and biological weapons, said the highly public attack appears to be "an expression of power" intended to send a message.

"There's echoes of Litvinenko — you are doing it in a way that makes it obvious you're doing it," he said.

Russia is "obviously a clear candidate," but it is too soon to say who was behind the attack, Guthrie added.

"It's also possible there could be some troublemaker out there who wants to make it look like it was Russia," he said.

Nerve agents are chemicals that disrupt the messages sent by the nerves to the body's organs. They can be administered in gas or liquid form, causing symptoms including vomiting, breathlessness, paralysis and often death. The banned VX nerve agent was used to kill the estranged half-brother of North Korea's leader last year in Malaysia.

Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, said there was a low risk to the public, but experts said nerve agents are highly dangerous and need to be processed with specialized care.

"Nerve agents are not materials that can be made at home," said Andrea Sella, a professor of inorganic chemistry at University College, London. "Their level of toxicity is such that they are only to be manufactured in specialized facilities."

Authorities will be looking to find impurities and residues that might provide clues as to the precise chemical process used to manufacture the material, Sella said.

"There is no question that the authorities will be looking for the container used to deliver the material, as the chemical contents would be a goldmine," Sella said. "With this information it might well be possible to trace the origin of the substance."

Police and forensics officers are focusing on three sites in Salisbury, a medieval city known for its towering cathedral, located 90 miles (145 kilometers) southwest of London. Rudd said the sites are Skripal's home, a pub and a restaurant.

Skripal, a former colonel in Russia's GRU military intelligence service, was convicted in 2006 of spying for Britain and imprisoned. He was freed in 2010 as part of a widely publicized spy swap in which the U.S. agreed to hand over 10 members of a Russian sleeper cell found operating in America in return for four Russians convicted of spying for the West.

Those who knew him in Salisbury were shocked, describing him as friendly and outgoing — hardly a man hiding out.

The owner of a local convenience shop frequented by Skripal described him as one of her favorite customers. Ebru Ozturk said she made sure to stock the food he liked, particularly smoked bacon and Polish salami.

Ozturk, 41, painted an image of an educated man enjoying his retirement — fond of playing the lottery and chatting with the locals.

"Usually he plays lottery and scratch cards," she said. "Plus a few weeks he was lucky as well and laughed about it."

A former Russian spy and his daughter were poisoned by a nerve agent in a "targeted" act, British authorities revealed Wednesday.

Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said a police officer who came into contact with the substance that sickened Sergei Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, also fell ill, collapsed, and is in "serious condition." All three are in comas, Sky News reported.

Rowley said authorities are "working closely with a wide range of specialists" to determine the exact nerve agent involved.

Rowley stressed that while police are treating the poisoning as an attempted murder, they have no evidence of a widespread threat to others. Chief medical officer Sally Davies told reporters the poisoning posed a "low risk" to the general public.

"Our role now is to find out who is behind the attacks," Rowley told reporters, adding that authorities as asking for the help from the public as they build a timeline of events of what led up to the poisoning. The Met Police said in a news release they are appealing to anybody who visited Salisbury town center and surrounding areas on Sunday for more information.

Home Secretary Amber Rudd said earlier in the day it was important to respond to evidence, not rumors. Rudd's comments came after she chaired a meeting of the government's emergency committee, known as Cobra, Sky News reported.

"There is a lot of information about him but I am not going to comment further about that," she said.

Her comments came as Russian officials said the case was being used to fuel an "anti-Russian campaign" and further strain ties with Britain.

"What happened to Skripal has been immediately used to further incite an anti-Russian campaign in Western media," Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.

EX-RUSSIAN SPY, DAUGHTER REMAIN IN CRITICAL CONDITION AS UK LAWMAKERS PROBE POSSIBLE KREMLIN LINK

Skripal, a former colonel in Russia's GRU military intelligence service, was convicted in 2006 of spying for Britain and imprisoned. He was freed in 2010 as part of a widely-publicized spy swap in which the U.S. agreed to hand over 10 members of a Russian sleeper cell found operating in America in return for four Russians convicted of spying for the West.

He and his daughter were found collapsed on a bench near a shopping mall Sunday in the town of Salisbury, 90 miles southwest of London.

On Wednesday, a Russian politician said that Skripal "wasn't interesting" to the Kremlin and he doesn't believe in Russian involvement in the alleged poisoning.

In an interview with Sky News, Andrei Lugovoi said Skripal had already served his time after being convicted in 2006 of spying for Britain and had been pardoned by the Russian president.

"I think that in this case, considering the rules of the Secret Services, the incident was over and done with," Lugovoi said.

Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told lawmakers Tuesday that if Moscow is shown to have been involved in the Skripal case, the government would act — possibly downgrading England's participation in this year's soccer World Cup in Russia. Johnson warned British officials may not be involved in the sporting event "in the normal way," but did not elaborate.

Police, fire and ambulance crews arrived outside Zizzi's restaurant in Salisbury on Wednesday close to the location where Skripal and his daughter were found as the investigation continues, according to Sky News.

A woman with dark hair was seen being taken out of Sarum House, next door to the pizzeria, and driven away in an ambulance.

A spokeswoman for South Western Ambulance Service told Sky News she was aware of what was happening, but added: "I'm sorry, we can't give anything out about that one."

CCTV has emerged of Skripal buying milk and bacon at a shop in Salisbury days before he and his daughter were found collapsed, Sky News reported.

POISONED EX-SPY LIKELY LATEST VICTIM IN LONG LINE OF KREMLIN-ORDERED HITS

While police say they are keeping an open mind about the case, it has reminded Britain of the 2006 poisoning of former spy Alexander Litvinenko.

A British inquiry into his death found that Russian agents poisoned him by lacing his tea with radioactive polonium-210 and that the killing was probably approved by President Vladimir Putin. Russia has denied any involvement in Litvinenko's death, and this week said it wasn't involved in Skripal's collapse.

Litvinenko's widow, Marina, wrote Wednesday in the Times of London that her husband's case made clear to Britain's emergency services that they need to act quickly when "someone suddenly falls mysteriously ill."

"I am happy my story has raised awareness about the potential danger posed by Moscow, and this could help to save somebody's life," she wrote in an opinion piece.

Calif. Teen Arrested For Impersonating Officer Made A Traffic Stop, House Calls

A 14-year-old is in custody in California after pretending to be a deputy sheriff. Victorville Police officials have arrested and booked the teen, who visited homes and pulled a woman over while dressed in a San Bernardino deputy sheriff's uniform.

The police department tweeted a video Wednesday showing what it found when officers searched the teen's home: the San Bernardino uniform he had used to impersonate an officer, a wig, "a large amount" of counterfeit money, multiple ballistic vests and simulation firearms.

"As you can see, he managed to collect quite a lot of equipment," Mara Rodriguez, the spokeswoman for the Victorville Police Department, told NPR on Thursday. Rodriguez said that some of the equipment was purchased online, though the department is still working to figure out where much of it came from.

The teen was driving a white Ford Explorer that belonged to his great-grandparents. He had attached flashing blue and red emergency lights to the inside of the windshield. The car had no law enforcement identifiers other than the lights, and the license plates had been removed, police said in a statement.

The young man was dressed in a police uniform with a simulation firearm in a holster when he paid a Victorville couple a visit Monday evening, claiming to be an officer investigating a domestic disturbance. The couple told him they had not called the police to report an incident and that there was no disturbance.

At this point, authorities said, the teen tried to open the couple's door, but found it locked. He left soon after, and the homeowners reported the incident.

"Sergeant J. Monroe saw a Ford Explorer matching the description of that involved in the incident," police said. "He conducted a traffic stop on the vehicle and confirmed it was a match. The 14-year old great-grandson of the registered owner was detained and later identified as the suspect."

The officers also learned that was not his only stop of the evening. After opening an investigation, officers discovered the teen had two other encounters before visiting the couple.

First, he pulled a woman over for a traffic violation before "letting her off with a warning." Later, he stopped at a home where a 16-year-old opened the door. Once again he claimed to be an officer investigating a domestic incident.

Victorville police said they are still trying to figure out who the other two people are and if there are other people who might have encountered the teen.

"We don't really know how long he's been doing this, and that's what we are trying to figure out right now," Rodriguez said. "We don't know for sure what he was trying to do ... it looks like he was just wanting to pretend to be a deputy."

The teen, who is on probation, was arrested and booked at High Desert Juvenile Detention Center.

A newly-discovered photo suggests legendary US pilot Amelia Earhart might have died in Japanese custody - and not in a plane crash in the Pacific.

If true, it would solve one of aviation history's biggest mysteries.

Earhart vanished during a 1937 flight over the Pacific - and her disappearance has been a breeding ground for speculation ever since.

A photograph from the 1930s shows a figure that could be her, taken on the then-Japanese Marshall Islands.

However, at least one prominent expert has poured cold water on the claim, saying he was "astounded" it had taken off.

The new material - presented as evidence for an old theory - is a black-and-white photograph found in the vaults of the US National Archives.

Image copyright Courtesy of Les Kinney/US National Archives Image caption Earhart, or not? The 1930s picture shows a group of people on the wharf at Jaluit Atoll

It shows a group of people standing on a dock. The label on the photograph says it was taken on Jaluit Atoll in the Marshall Islands, presumably by a US spy.

The link might seem thin, though, to the legendary pilot who five years before her disappearance had risen to fame as the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic.

The claim is that one seated person with her back to the camera could be Earhart, while another figure on the far left in the photo is said to be Fred Noonan, her navigator on that last flight.

On the very right of the picture is a blurry section which, it is claimed, shows Earhart's plane.

Image copyright Courtesy of Les Kinney/US National Archives Image caption These magnified details of the new picture are alleged to show (from left), navigator Fred Noonan, Earhart herself, and their plane

Ric Gillespie, author of Finding Amelia and executive director of The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR), is certainly unconvinced.

He told the BBC: "This photograph has people convinced. I'm astounded by this. I mean, my God! Look at this photograph... Let's use our heads for a moment. It's undated. They think it's from 1937. Okay. If it's from July 1, 1937 then it can't be Amelia, because she hadn't taken off yet.

"If it's from 1935 or 1938 it can't be her.... This photograph has to have been taken within a very narrow window - within a couple of days of when she disappeared."

He notes that the photograph came from an Office of Naval Intelligence file, saying it was "very natural" the US would want a picture of this Japanese naval asset.

"And what does the photo say that it shows? ... Jaluit Atoll - Jaluit Island. It doesn't say 'Amelia Earhart in Japanese custody'!

"If this is a picture of Amelia Earhart in Japanese custody, where are the Japanese? There are no soldiers in this picture. Nobody in uniform," he observes.

Image copyright Laurie Rubin Image caption Ric Gillespie, author of Finding Amelia, does not believe the picture shows Earhart and her navigator

The photograph was released by the US-based History channel ahead of a documentary to run this weekend. If the goal was to drum up attention - and hence audience numbers - it appears to have paid off.

A preview of the programme has two experts backing up the claim by looking at the torso measurements of the woman alleged to be Amelia Earhart in the photo, and teeth and hairline of the figure claimed to be Fred Noonan.

Mystery hunters and stories

A far stretch? After all, the heroine has her back to the camera and it's debatable how much of a hairline let alone teeth can really be made out reliably on a faded photograph from the 1930s.

Mr Gillespie says it doesn't match other known pictures of the famous aviator.

"The person who they say is Amelia Earhart might be a white woman. But her hair is way too long to be Amelia's. We have many pictures of Earhart taken the day before she took off, and her hair's a lot shorter than that."

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The fate of Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan has long fascinated historians

He adds that the man identified as Fred Noonan does not, in his view, resemble the navigator. Further, his shirt is the wrong colour.

"The man is dressed in white. Noonan always wore dark shirts and dark slacks. Amelia didn't have a shirt like that with her on the trip either. So the Japanese have apparently given them new clothes.

"Everything about this is wrong," he concludes. "I'm astounded."

Did she crash on land?

Scepticism aside, the alleged scoop feeds into one of the existing theories about what happened to Earhart and her navigator.

She disappeared during her attempt to fly around the globe, trying to reach Howland Island in the Pacific for refuelling.

The official explanation is that she didn't find the island, lost communication and ran out of fuel, only to crash into the ocean.

While that's a largely accepted version of events, there is no evidence - as in debris - to back it up.

The two other prominent theories are that Earhart crash-landed on or near the then-Japanese Marshall Islands, or that she made it to Nikumaroro island near Kiribati and died a castaway there.

There is no conclusive evidence for either of these theories - but that hasn't stopped amateur and professional historians from digging into them.

Image copyright TIGHAR Image caption Nikumaroro island was uninhabited at the time Earhart would have landed there

Parts of a skeleton found on Nikumaroro in 1940 were initially thought to have been hers, but doctors at the time decided they belonged to a male body.

Mr Gillespie, who backs the Nikumaroro theory, has led 11 expeditions in the South Pacific to research Earhart's fate. He points out that the island was uninhabited at the time when Earhart would have landed there.

He and his team have recovered artefacts which they say strongly suggest the presence of an American woman from the right era - including a makeup box from the 1930s, a popular US women's moisturiser, and a jacket zipper.

Image copyright TIGHAR Image caption Ric Gillespie and his team excavating on Nikumaroro, where they believe Earhart's plane came down

Image copyright TIGHAR Image caption The team found a bone-handled jack knife that matches one mentioned in Earhart's inventory

Mr Gillespie also cites the timing and location of radio distress calls sent by Earhart after her plane came down. He says the calls were sent "night after night" - which would suggest the plane was on land, not in the water - because if the radios got wet, they wouldn't work.

"After six nights the radio signals stopped," he told the BBC. "We now think that's because the airplane was landed on the reef round the island, which is flat, smooth - dries at low tide... But the tide does come in and go out, and ... by the sixth night [he believes] the aeroplane was washed into the ocean by the tides.

"So when the planes from the battleship flew over the island a week later, no plane was visible."

The rest of the search took place in open ocean, and found nothing. The would-be rescuers concluded that Earhart and Noonan had sunk without a trace.

A mystery still unsolved

The conclusion drawn by the History documentary, based on the new Marshall Islands picture, is that Earhart was taken by the Japanese, later interned and eventually died a prisoner of war.

The Marshall Islands went from German to Japanese hands during World War One, and ahead of the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor became an important military post for Tokyo.

The Japanese archives have no records of Earhart as a prisoner - but with many documents from these archives known to have been lost, this does not necessarily prove the story wrong.

At the same time, the discovery of a single photograph that may or may not show the two lost pilots is likely to add to the mystery rather than solve it.

Bold (and bald) women, royal matriarchs, independent, astute ladies, stern, witty and humorous women - this is Black Panther. Female representation in all of its nuance is refreshingly depicted in this box office record-making film. There are female military generals, engineers, and advisers, as well as strong queens and princesses.

Since the film made its debut in the cinemas, news media, social media, private conversations, fashion magazines and even classrooms have been agog with references to the film and hashtags like #WakandaForever, #WakandaCameToSlay, #WhatWakandaMeansToMe, and more.

Different people see different things in this film: some draw parallels between the vibranium-wealthy nation of Wakanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo with its cobalt - as the demand for electric cars, that require cobalt, is set to increase over the upcoming years. While others, when watching King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) and Killmonger (Michael B Jordan), reflect on identity politics and perhaps the complex relationship between Africans and African Americans. The all-female Wakandan army reminds history lovers of the women soldiers of Dahomey of the 18th and 19th centuries.

While one could reflect deeply on many of the overt or more subtle aspects of the Marvel film, for me, one thing particularly stood out throughout the movie: the depth and nuance with which the female characters were explored.

Representing women of colour

Intersectionality, a term coined by feminist professor Kimberle Crenshaw, looks into the various ways in which women, and particularly women of colour, and more specifically women of colour who are poor, face layered forms of discrimination.

For example, some black women are deemed to be more employable than others because of their hairstyle choices. Mainstream beauty trends pressure black women to conform to certain external presentation styles simply to look "presentable" or even "acceptable" in the media, workplace and even schools. Not too long ago, Pretoria Girls' High School was the subject of much scrutiny when it was revealed that the school administration was telling black pupils to straighten their hair and not wear afros that were deemed "untidy".

{articleGUID}

Black women's hair is apparently political. Meaning two black women, one with relaxed straight hair and another with no hair or a big afro, may face different levels of discrimination - which brings us back to Crenshaw's intersectionality debate.

This is where Black Panther differs from other mainstream movies. What Black Panther does is explore the varying ways in which black women may choose to portray themselves.

In the film, there are bald black women who occupy spaces of power and career success - bald and strong women standing at the King's side to protect him. There is Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) who wears beautiful Bantu knots, Shuri (Letitia Wright) who rocks striking braids, Ramonda (Angela Bassett) who mesmerises in her regal headpieces and of course, there is bald, strong and impressive Okoye (Danai Gurira).

This kind of varied physical representation of women normalises the different ways in which women, black women, can choose to present themselves. It sends out the message that black women do not need to conform to any beauty standard to be respectable, presentable and beautiful.

The future is female; the future is African

The black women in Black Panther are strong and resilient, and their strength is revered (and not feared) by the men in their lives.

We are first introduced to the strong and poised queen Ramonda - who had just lost her husband, former King T'Chaka - standing tall and graceful and in support of her son, the new king. Then there is Princess Shuri, a smart, tech-savvy, witty, young woman (Wakanda's chief engineer) who holds her own throughout the film. Despite Shuri's young age, she is given the significant responsibilities of maintaining and advancing the technological advancements of the Kingdom of Wakanda - responsibilities she effectively lives up to.

Nakia is a spy who has dedicated her life to protecting women held in captivity outside the borders of Wakanda - she has a sense of agency, focus. Nakia is wise and offers counsel to King T'Challa, who greatly admires her. Then there is the tough Okoye, a stern warrior with a wry sense of humour, the commander of the all-female military that protects the King and leads Wakanda to victory.

All these female characters are multidimensional. The women represented in this predominantly black film are not depicted in a single continuum; instead, they speak to pluralistic sets of experiences women face. They represent women of colour who are young or old, stern or witty, career-focused or family-oriented.

This film reassures young girls, but especially black girls, that going into STEM-related subjects is cool and possible and that they too (young as they maybe) can thrive at the helm of an entire country's technological progress. Black Panther affirms career women that their absolute focus and sense of agency is admirable.

All in all, Black Panther put female empowerment on full display on the big screen and reminded us all that the future is female; the future is African. Wakanda Forever!

In today's world, a work wife is usually thought of as an office buddy. She celebrates your successes and downplays your failures. You cry on her shoulder in the break room.

But "work wife" wasn't always about friendship.

The term appears in popular use as far back as 1929, when Faith Baldwin's book "The Office Wife" novelized a traditional concept: that men need wives for work and wives for home.

The Peggy Olsons and Joan Holloways of the "Mad Men" world weren't supposed to be friends, they were supposed to serve as spousal stand-ins for the Don Drapers and Roger Sterlings.

That didn't mean they were men's partners, or even their equals. Instead, they were helpmates, there to solve dry-cleaning crises, schedule meetings or answer calls from the at-home wives.

That slowly started to change as more women entered the workforce in the late 20th century, and female alliances became a necessity for women to survive sexist workplaces or move up the corporate ladder.

But a new problem arose, as competition among women intensified and assimilating into the male culture was often presented as the best way to get ahead. On-screen portrayals of working women like "Dynasty" or even "Working Girl" upheld a toxic myth: that at the top, there's only room for one woman. Not two.

Kayleen Schaefer, author of "Text Me When You Get Home," a new book about the power of female friendship, says early on in her career she also wrestled with a desire to "be one of the guys."

As a journalist in a male-dominated newsroom, she didn't seek out a work wife of her own.

"I felt that I had to set myself apart from other women to stand out," she says. "I really loved being one of the guys when I felt like I was. I stayed away from making friends with other women in the workplace, which was a mistake."

Related: Does high school drama follow women to the workplace?

In the #MeToo era, when the power of women-led whisper networks roars to life, female work relationships feel more important than ever.

Research shows that friendship in the workplace is often a good thing. A study from the Harvard Business Review showed that employees who said they had close friends at work were more engaged doing the job than those who didn't have the same support.

Those with positive social connections at work report improved productivity, creativity and overall well-being, according to Emma Seppala, author of "The Happiness Track" and faculty director of the Yale School of Management's Women's Leadership Program.

Networking with other women is especially important for female employees who have historically been left out of the old boys' clubs, golf outings and other chances to rub elbows with high-level execs.

"If you develop strong social networks of women, you're starting to create a culture shift where women support women and maybe start to disrupt that male-dominated hierarchy," Seppala says.

When Schaefer later met her own "work wife" in that same newsroom, she realized that cutting herself off from other women had been a mistake. From then on, she says, everything changed.

"Meeting her was a real shift in my perspective for women in the workplace," she says. "Having that [friendship] helped me do my job better and helped me feel way more secure and comfortable in my own skills and my own voice."

A look at women and girls around the world on International Women's Day.

Samantha Hanahentzen, 17, poses for a #MeToo portrait in Detroit, Michigan, October 29, 2017. "When I saw the #MeToo hashtag I was just coming to terms with my sexual assault. It happened when I was in middle school by one of my teachers. It took me a while to come forward with what had happened to me and then when I went to the administration I was told I didn't have enough evidence to prove anything and I should just keep quiet about it because I and the school could be sued for slander if I went public with my experience. It was really silencing because when I was being assaulted it was that stereotypical line of 'let's keep this between me and you.' And then when I found the courage to come out I was told again 'let's keep this quiet.' So for me too, it was a way to have a voice and it was a way for me to see that I'm not the only one that has gone through this and that women all around the world have all experienced the same thing. It was really unifying."

Politicians in the Florida House have passed a school safety bill that includes new restrictions on rifle sales and a programme to arm some teachers.

The measure, a response to the shooting at Parkland high school that left 17 dead last month, was supported by the victims' families.

The school safety bill has been sent to Florida's Governor Rick Scott for his signature. If he signs it, the bill becomes law within 15 days.

The proposals include raising the minimum age for buying rifles from 18 to 21.

After #MeToo, there's been a lot more talk about the advancement of women in the workforce. But how do we actually achieve it?

What are substantive, tangible, actionable steps that can get us to true gender equality at work?

A new report from Accenture, a global management consulting and professional services firm, has some answers.

After surveying more than 22,000 working women and men with a college education in 34 countries, Accenture identified 40 factors that influence advancement of women in the workplace. The company then narrowed the list to 14 "cultural drivers" that are most likely to affect change.

Those factors include a company setting diversity goals and announcing them externally, policies and programs including encouraging men — not just women — to take leave after the birth of a child, and an empowering work environment that includes making remote work widely available.

Ellyn Shook, Accenture's chief leadership and human resources officer, said many companies today are working hard to get more women to the C-suite and into the workforce, but are coming up short because they're not focusing on their overall culture.

For its part, Accenture has pledged to get to a 50% male, 50% female workforce by 2025.

"When you look at the how, the how is around programs and practices and that just simply isn't enough," said Shook, one of the authors of the report.

"When we went through our own journey, really it became very clear to us that in order to drive equality, we needed to have a culture that supported equality."

Related: After #MeToo, what men need to know about working with women

Other cultural factors identified in the report include never asking employees to change their appearance to comply with company culture, providing training to keep employees' skills relevant, letting workers work from home on a day they have a personal commitment and making employees feel comfortable reporting incidents of sexual discrimination and sexual harassment.

"It's doable. It's not theoretical," said Shook.

One of the more surprising findings was that company networks that are exclusive to women help promote gender equality, but businesses with women's networks that are open to both women and men help more.

"It's essential that organizations do not over-rotate just on women. It's about creating the level playing field," said Shook. "I think companies that have created a lot of women's programs are well-intentioned but what the research found is that they don't really help women accelerate their progress."

Related: #MeToo and #TimesUp have pushed 48% of companies to review pay policies

The upside, according to the report, is game-changing. If the 40 factors that drive advancement were found in all work environments globally, for every 100 male managers, there could be up to 84 female managers versus 34 today.

Women would be 35% more likely to advance to manager and four times (280%) more likely to advance to senior manager/director and beyond, according to Accenture. And that pay gap, where women earn $73 for every $100 a man earns today would be nearly wiped away. A woman could earn $92 for every $100 a man earns.

But the gains wouldn't just be for women. Countering a concern from some men that equality in the workplace translates into women gaining at the expense of men, the Accenture report found that "when women rise, men rise, too."

In companies where the 40 factors exist, men are 23% more likely to move up to manager level and more than twice as likely to advance to a senior manager or director position.

"What really surprised me and frankly delighted me is that if you can drive a culture of equality, everybody rises," said Shook. "And I did not expect to see that."
