Bold (and bald) women, royal matriarchs, independent, astute ladies, stern, witty and humorous women - this is Black Panther. Female representation in all of its nuance is refreshingly depicted in this box office record-making film. There are female military generals, engineers, and advisers, as well as strong queens and princesses.

Since the film made its debut in the cinemas, news media, social media, private conversations, fashion magazines and even classrooms have been agog with references to the film and hashtags like #WakandaForever, #WakandaCameToSlay, #WhatWakandaMeansToMe, and more.

Different people see different things in this film: some draw parallels between the vibranium-wealthy nation of Wakanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo with its cobalt - as the demand for electric cars, that require cobalt, is set to increase over the upcoming years. While others, when watching King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) and Killmonger (Michael B Jordan), reflect on identity politics and perhaps the complex relationship between Africans and African Americans. The all-female Wakandan army reminds history lovers of the women soldiers of Dahomey of the 18th and 19th centuries.

While one could reflect deeply on many of the overt or more subtle aspects of the Marvel film, for me, one thing particularly stood out throughout the movie: the depth and nuance with which the female characters were explored.

Representing women of colour

Intersectionality, a term coined by feminist professor Kimberle Crenshaw, looks into the various ways in which women, and particularly women of colour, and more specifically women of colour who are poor, face layered forms of discrimination.

For example, some black women are deemed to be more employable than others because of their hairstyle choices. Mainstream beauty trends pressure black women to conform to certain external presentation styles simply to look "presentable" or even "acceptable" in the media, workplace and even schools. Not too long ago, Pretoria Girls' High School was the subject of much scrutiny when it was revealed that the school administration was telling black pupils to straighten their hair and not wear afros that were deemed "untidy".

Black women's hair is apparently political. Meaning two black women, one with relaxed straight hair and another with no hair or a big afro, may face different levels of discrimination - which brings us back to Crenshaw's intersectionality debate.

This is where Black Panther differs from other mainstream movies. What Black Panther does is explore the varying ways in which black women may choose to portray themselves.

In the film, there are bald black women who occupy spaces of power and career success - bald and strong women standing at the King's side to protect him. There is Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) who wears beautiful Bantu knots, Shuri (Letitia Wright) who rocks striking braids, Ramonda (Angela Bassett) who mesmerises in her regal headpieces and of course, there is bald, strong and impressive Okoye (Danai Gurira).

This kind of varied physical representation of women normalises the different ways in which women, black women, can choose to present themselves. It sends out the message that black women do not need to conform to any beauty standard to be respectable, presentable and beautiful.

The future is female; the future is African

The black women in Black Panther are strong and resilient, and their strength is revered (and not feared) by the men in their lives.

We are first introduced to the strong and poised queen Ramonda - who had just lost her husband, former King T'Chaka - standing tall and graceful and in support of her son, the new king. Then there is Princess Shuri, a smart, tech-savvy, witty, young woman (Wakanda's chief engineer) who holds her own throughout the film. Despite Shuri's young age, she is given the significant responsibilities of maintaining and advancing the technological advancements of the Kingdom of Wakanda - responsibilities she effectively lives up to.

Nakia is a spy who has dedicated her life to protecting women held in captivity outside the borders of Wakanda - she has a sense of agency, focus. Nakia is wise and offers counsel to King T'Challa, who greatly admires her. Then there is the tough Okoye, a stern warrior with a wry sense of humour, the commander of the all-female military that protects the King and leads Wakanda to victory.

All these female characters are multidimensional. The women represented in this predominantly black film are not depicted in a single continuum; instead, they speak to pluralistic sets of experiences women face. They represent women of colour who are young or old, stern or witty, career-focused or family-oriented.

This film reassures young girls, but especially black girls, that going into STEM-related subjects is cool and possible and that they too (young as they maybe) can thrive at the helm of an entire country's technological progress. Black Panther affirms career women that their absolute focus and sense of agency is admirable.

All in all, Black Panther put female empowerment on full display on the big screen and reminded us all that the future is female; the future is African. Wakanda Forever!

In today's world, a work wife is usually thought of as an office buddy. She celebrates your successes and downplays your failures. You cry on her shoulder in the break room.

But "work wife" wasn't always about friendship.

The term appears in popular use as far back as 1929, when Faith Baldwin's book "The Office Wife" novelized a traditional concept: that men need wives for work and wives for home.

The Peggy Olsons and Joan Holloways of the "Mad Men" world weren't supposed to be friends, they were supposed to serve as spousal stand-ins for the Don Drapers and Roger Sterlings.

That didn't mean they were men's partners, or even their equals. Instead, they were helpmates, there to solve dry-cleaning crises, schedule meetings or answer calls from the at-home wives.

That slowly started to change as more women entered the workforce in the late 20th century, and female alliances became a necessity for women to survive sexist workplaces or move up the corporate ladder.

But a new problem arose, as competition among women intensified and assimilating into the male culture was often presented as the best way to get ahead. On-screen portrayals of working women like "Dynasty" or even "Working Girl" upheld a toxic myth: that at the top, there's only room for one woman. Not two.

Kayleen Schaefer, author of "Text Me When You Get Home," a new book about the power of female friendship, says early on in her career she also wrestled with a desire to "be one of the guys."

As a journalist in a male-dominated newsroom, she didn't seek out a work wife of her own.

"I felt that I had to set myself apart from other women to stand out," she says. "I really loved being one of the guys when I felt like I was. I stayed away from making friends with other women in the workplace, which was a mistake."

Related: Does high school drama follow women to the workplace?

In the #MeToo era, when the power of women-led whisper networks roars to life, female work relationships feel more important than ever.

Research shows that friendship in the workplace is often a good thing. A study from the Harvard Business Review showed that employees who said they had close friends at work were more engaged doing the job than those who didn't have the same support.

Those with positive social connections at work report improved productivity, creativity and overall well-being, according to Emma Seppala, author of "The Happiness Track" and faculty director of the Yale School of Management's Women's Leadership Program.

Networking with other women is especially important for female employees who have historically been left out of the old boys' clubs, golf outings and other chances to rub elbows with high-level execs.

"If you develop strong social networks of women, you're starting to create a culture shift where women support women and maybe start to disrupt that male-dominated hierarchy," Seppala says.

When Schaefer later met her own "work wife" in that same newsroom, she realized that cutting herself off from other women had been a mistake. From then on, she says, everything changed.

"Meeting her was a real shift in my perspective for women in the workplace," she says. "Having that [friendship] helped me do my job better and helped me feel way more secure and comfortable in my own skills and my own voice."

After #MeToo, there's been a lot more talk about the advancement of women in the workforce. But how do we actually achieve it?

What are substantive, tangible, actionable steps that can get us to true gender equality at work?

A new report from Accenture, a global management consulting and professional services firm, has some answers.

After surveying more than 22,000 working women and men with a college education in 34 countries, Accenture identified 40 factors that influence advancement of women in the workplace. The company then narrowed the list to 14 "cultural drivers" that are most likely to affect change.

Those factors include a company setting diversity goals and announcing them externally, policies and programs including encouraging men — not just women — to take leave after the birth of a child, and an empowering work environment that includes making remote work widely available.

Ellyn Shook, Accenture's chief leadership and human resources officer, said many companies today are working hard to get more women to the C-suite and into the workforce, but are coming up short because they're not focusing on their overall culture.

For its part, Accenture has pledged to get to a 50% male, 50% female workforce by 2025.

"When you look at the how, the how is around programs and practices and that just simply isn't enough," said Shook, one of the authors of the report.

"When we went through our own journey, really it became very clear to us that in order to drive equality, we needed to have a culture that supported equality."

Related: After #MeToo, what men need to know about working with women

Other cultural factors identified in the report include never asking employees to change their appearance to comply with company culture, providing training to keep employees' skills relevant, letting workers work from home on a day they have a personal commitment and making employees feel comfortable reporting incidents of sexual discrimination and sexual harassment.

"It's doable. It's not theoretical," said Shook.

One of the more surprising findings was that company networks that are exclusive to women help promote gender equality, but businesses with women's networks that are open to both women and men help more.

"It's essential that organizations do not over-rotate just on women. It's about creating the level playing field," said Shook. "I think companies that have created a lot of women's programs are well-intentioned but what the research found is that they don't really help women accelerate their progress."

Related: #MeToo and #TimesUp have pushed 48% of companies to review pay policies

The upside, according to the report, is game-changing. If the 40 factors that drive advancement were found in all work environments globally, for every 100 male managers, there could be up to 84 female managers versus 34 today.

Women would be 35% more likely to advance to manager and four times (280%) more likely to advance to senior manager/director and beyond, according to Accenture. And that pay gap, where women earn $73 for every $100 a man earns today would be nearly wiped away. A woman could earn $92 for every $100 a man earns.

Related: Calls for paid leave growing louder

But the gains wouldn't just be for women. Countering a concern from some men that equality in the workplace translates into women gaining at the expense of men, the Accenture report found that "when women rise, men rise, too."

In companies where the 40 factors exist, men are 23% more likely to move up to manager level and more than twice as likely to advance to a senior manager or director position.

"What really surprised me and frankly delighted me is that if you can drive a culture of equality, everybody rises," said Shook. "And I did not expect to see that."

Women of the world

A look at women and girls around the world on International Women's Day.

Samantha Hanahentzen, 17, poses for a #MeToo portrait in Detroit, Michigan, October 29, 2017. "When I saw the #MeToo hashtag I was just coming to terms with my sexual assault. It happened when I was in middle school by one of my teachers. It took me a while to come forward with what had happened to me and then when I went to the administration I was told I didn't have enough evidence to prove anything and I should just keep quiet about it because I and the school could be sued for slander if I went public with my experience. It was really silencing because when I was being assaulted it was that stereotypical line of 'let's keep this between me and you.' And then when I found the courage to come out I was told again 'let's keep this quiet.' So for me too, it was a way to have a voice and it was a way for me to see that I'm not the only one that has gone through this and that women all around the world have all experienced the same thing. It was really unifying."

McDonald's is celebrating International Women's Day with a big, gleaming W.

"For the first time in our brand history, we flipped our iconic arches," said McDonald's Chief Diversity Officer Wendy Lewis.

The giant arches were physically flipped at one California restaurant. On Thursday, International Women's Day, upside-down arches replaced right-side-up arches across McDonald's digital channels.

Lewis said McDonald's is flipping its logo "in honor of the extraordinary accomplishments of women everywhere."

The upside down signage was put up outside a restaurant outside Los Angeles, in Lynwood, California. Mayor José Luis Solache took note in an Instagram post.

The restaurant chain will also mark the occasion at another 100 US locations, where McDonald's (MCD) employees will wear special hats and shirts.

In recent years, companies have started using International Women's Day to broadcast their views on gender equality.

"International Women's day is a perfect opportunity for brands to talk about their commitment to empowerment," said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.

Related: McDonald's is taking cheeseburgers out of the Happy Meal

"It's a perfect venue to get out there and enhance your brand perception," he said.

In a statement, McDonald's said that 6 out of 10 managers of US restaurants are women.

"We have a long history of supporting women in the workplace," the company added.

Brands may also be eager to replicate the success of others, Calkins said.

"When companies see high-profile campaigns that get some traction and get some discussion, they are very quick to jump on the bandwagon."

Related: McDonald's is going green

One example of a particularly successful campaign is the "Fearless Girl," sculpture, which was installed across the "Charging Bull," in New York City by State Street ahead of International Women's Day last year.

The statue was designed by the financial services company and the advertising firm McCann to call attention to State Street's efforts to improve gender diversity on corporate boards. But it soon took on a life of its own.

Magic Johnson Theaters in Harlem, or AMC Magic Johnson Harlem 9 on Frederick Douglas Blvd to be precise, is where my children and I spend many of our weekend outings. It is the closest theatre to where we live on Columbia University campus, and closest to my heart as an urban setting that resonates deeply with a history that defines me in every major city I have lived in and loved from Tehran to Mexico City.

It's not just the theatre itself, but also the neighbourhood - near the historic Apollo Theater - that I both love and mourn at one and the same time. I love it because it is the closest destination that feels like home to me and it is the theatre frequented the most by my children's classmates from a local public school. I mourn it because the harder I look the more I see Malcolm X and James Baldwin's Harlem disappearing under the thin veneer of the gaudy Clintonite-Obamaesque gentrification of MLK Boulevard.

It makes no difference if you are there to watch Peter Rabbit (2018) or Black Panther (2018), there is a buzz about the place, before and after the show, that brings the entire history of Harlem as the epicenter of African American cultural history to bear on the mundane matter-of-fact routine of a family outing.

Can cliches deliver?

One must see Black Panther in Harlem, or any other inner-city epicenter of African American life in the United States, for Black Panther is an American film about black liberation - produced by Marvel and distributed by Disney - with all the perils and promises of that paradox oozing into the air when you sit down with your drink and popcorn to watch the movie.

People around the world unfamiliar with the sustained course of institutional racism in the US may justly wonder what the big deal about this film is. The conflicting thoughts and emotions the film has generated among its American audiences - particularly the African American community - is rooted in these two conflicting facts: it is a corporate production that promises to act as a cathartic moment for black liberation. It does both. It is a deeply satisfying, and it is a deeply troubling film, for both what it delivers and what it does not.

{articleGUID}

Black Panther is not just an American film - it is, in fact, replete with Hollywood cliches. Its very premise is a Hollywood cliche - that somewhere deep in Africa there is an advanced civilisation called the kingdom of Wakanda sitting on vast swaths of enriching energy is as old as Tarzan films where European hunters were ravaging the jungles in search of ivory.

Black Panther has actually two Tarzans instead of one: One is the CIA agent, Everett K Ross (Martin Freeman), there to save Africans from themselves, and the other, if you had the patience and prudence to sit to the end of the credit rolls, is Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Captain America's best friend, who we see wandering out of a tent in a Wakandan village to meet Shuri, T'Challa/ Black Panther's (Chadwick Boseman) young genius sister who will now presumably start acting as Q to this James Bond!

There is also an intertextual reference to El Dorado in Black Panther that invokes yet another Hollywood cliche - El Dorado as a man, a city, a kingdom, or perhaps even an empire at the centre of so many "Indiana Jones" characters in search of sudden riches.

The scenes of T'Challa/Black Panther in New York are inevitable allusions to Prince Akeem Joffer, the prince of Zamunda (Eddie Murphy) in the John Landis' romantic comedy Coming to America (1988). Hollywood has a very limited cinematic vocabulary, and it uses and recycles them regularly. They work. They sell. Why bother?

The joy is real

Like the entire audience around me, I basked in Black Panther like a wide-eyed-child, nervously munching on my popcorn to the very last. I had not been so engrossed in a film since I cannot recall when. I was T'Challa. I was Black Panther - until N'Jadaka, Erik "Killmonger" appeared. Then I was Killmonger. The movie wanted me to take a side: you are either Black Panther or Killmonger. It would not allow you be both. I took a side. I stayed with my defiant brother N'Jadaka to the bitter end. The movie failed to change my heart and politics. From then on, Black Panther went its Obama way; I went with Killmonger.

This is an American film, and you have to be an African American, or someone deeply identifying with them, seeing their suffering and hopes in the mirror of other colonially ravaged nations, honouring their history and standing in solidarity with their struggles, to understand their joyous celebration of seeing themselves in triumphant agency in this film. You have to have seen the horrors of pernicious black representations, from Blackface trope to common criminals, to see the beauty and power of this film.

In a brilliant Facebook post, my distinguished Columbia colleague, the eminent critical race theorist Kimberle Williams Crenshaw began by sharing this ecstasy, "The sheer joy of drinking it all in made me realize just how thirsty I was for such visual treats. I savored every last drop, the fierce warrior sistas, the humor, the geniuses, Black love, all the things we just don't get to see. Joy."

Other critical reviewers shared that sentiment: Khanya Khondlo Mtshali said in a review for the Guardian, "There's no denying how necessary Black Panther is for representation. In a world where diversity is so often treated as an act of charity instead of a reality, this film challenges the pervasive idea that our heroes can only be white and male."

Crenshaw and Mtshali were right. I felt like the teenaged me, waking up in the early morning hours to watch Mohammad Ali's boxing matches on television in my hometown in southern Iran. We were kings.

Until you sober up

It is not until Killmonger appears and the script begins to demonise him that you realise you have been duped, taken for a ride, bamboozled, as Malcolm would say. It is then that you realise T'Challa is made up to look like the screen version of Obama doing "community work!" A bucket of cold water joy-killer! The CIA White Savior Fantasy now begins to bite like a venomous snake.

Kimberle Crenshaw puts it succinctly:

Like remembering a drunken night thru a hangover haze, I kept wondering how I'd come to dance on the table for the CIA? The ones that helped destroy the dream of African liberation, that had a hand in the assassination of Lumumba, staged a coup against Nkrumah, tipped off the arrest that imprisoned Mandela, installed the vicious, nation-destroying Mobutu?

This is when a sober mind catches itself off-guard. We were all taken off-guard by Black Panther - by its beguiling power and timely seduction, taking us back to when we cheered for John Wayne killing Native Americans, not knowing we were the Native Americans.

Crenshaw concludes with the precision of her habitual critical thinking: "Black power has always been framed by its critics as dangerous, irrational, bloodthirsty revenge. Today's identity extremists were yesterday's Panthers and Pan Africanists. How did that libelous trope come to be the central tension in this celebration of Black superheroes?"

This is the moment that, half-way through the film, as soon as the directorial and the visuals wanted me to side with Black Panther, with T'Challa against Killmonger, I said no thank you and opted out.

I was of course not the only one. Christopher Lebron echoes Crenshaw and carries the insight forwards in an equally brilliant review in the Boston Globe:

Killmonger is the revolutionary willing to take what he wants by any means necessary, but he lacks any coherent political philosophy. Rather than the enlightened radical, he comes across as the black thug from Oakland hell bent on killing for killing's sake - indeed, his body is marked with a scar for every kill he has made. The abundant evidence of his efficacy does not establish Killmonger as a hero or villain so much as a receptacle for tropes of inner-city gangsterism.

The final diagnosis is now easy to see. This Black Panther is not just Obamaesque. It is Obama. As James Wilt puts it: "... at its core, Black Panther contains a fundamentally reactionary understanding of black liberation that blatantly advocates bourgeois respectability over revolution, sterilizes the history of real-life anti-colonial struggles in Africa and elsewhere, and allows white folks such as myself to feel extremely comfortable watching it - which, given Marvel's sole purpose, is almost certainly the bottom line."

In the end, you get up the following day, reassured that Hollywood gave it all it had to suck you into a delusional fantasy of Africa and African-Americans. But the beauty, the power, the truth of critical thinkers I take with me to see a movie in Harlem - from Malcolm X and James Baldwin to Angela Davis and Kimberle Crenshaw - are far more ennobling companies to keep.

Starbucks SBUX

In 2018, brands are leaning into International Women's Day — and using it as an opportunity to broadcast their commitment to gender equality.

Tunay Firat, partnership development specialist at UN Women said that over the past several months, companies have been asking her about ways to get involved. In previous years, she's often been the one to initiate contact.

"I would call it a societal shift," she said. "[Companies are] reaching out to me from all around the world."

Something like this, she added "has never happened since the inception of UN Women," the United Nation's group dedicated to empowering women.

"Brands are always looking for opportunities to leverage events to shape their perceptions," said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.

"International Women's Day is a perfect opportunity for brands to talk about their commitment to empowerment."

For some big companies, the event has become a focal point for major campaigns.

This year, Mattel planned its "biggest global effort to date timed to International Women's Day," said Lisa McKnight, global general manager for Barbie, during an analyst event in February.

In honor of #InternationalWomensDay, we are committed to shining a light on empowering female role models past and present in an effort to inspire more girls.

Though Mattel (MAT) is only offering three new Barbie dolls for purchase right away, it's planning to roll out another 14 "Shero" dolls — including ones based on Olympic snowboarding champion Chloe Kim and "Wonder Woman" director Patty Jenkins.

The company is also inviting customers to tweet using the hashtag #MoreRoleModels to shout out women who inspire them.

Procter & Gamble (PG) launched its biggest campaign around International Women's Day, called We See Equal, in 2017 and continued to build on it this year.

Allison Tummon Kamphuis, who leads P&G's gender equality program, explained that the company's first big push came after it named gender equality as one of its initiatives in 2016.

In previous years, P&G observed International Women's Day internally, with lectures and events for staff. Now, the company hosts several public-facing events, including a discussion with Katie Couric and an interactive exhibit called "Women at Work: Myth vs Reality."

Firat pointed to P&G as a company that has genuinely committed to promoting gender equality.

While some brands have given International Women's Day a lot of thought, others are still trying to figure out a way in. Firat said that some companies hope a campaign featuring women's empowerment will help them reach Millennials, who tend to value brands that embrace social causes.

Calkins suggested that some companies may also be chasing the success of others.

"Marketers watch what other marketers are doing," he said.

"When companies see high-profile campaigns that get some traction ... they are very quick to jump on the bandwagon."

Though there are advantages to joining a conversation about gender, there are also risks. "If you're going to be out there celebrating your commitment to gender equality, then it does invite some scrutiny," Calkins said.

One example, he said, is the "Fearless Girl" statue.

The sculpture was conceived by the powerful financial group State Street (STT) and advertising firm McCann as a way to spread awareness of State Street's efforts to increase gender diversity on corporate boards.

Related: Awkward! Company behind 'Fearless Girl' settles gender pay dispute

The campaign was an overwhelming success People fell in love with the statue of the defiant girl staring down the "Charging Bull" in New York City, and she quickly became a symbol of resistance and empowerment.

But the sculpture's prominence put State Street in the spotlight when it agreed to pay $5 million to settle allegations that it underpaid female and black employees. The firm denied any wrongdoing.

And McDonald's (MCD), which has faced protests by employees seeking higher wages, is already being criticized for honoring the day with what some see as an empty gesture.

In the opening pages of her new book, reporter Bernice Yeung quotes feminist writer Audre Lorde.

The woman's place of power within each of us is neither white or surface; it is dark, it is ancient, and it is deep.

Yeung's "In a Day's Work: The Fight to End Sexual Violence Among America's Most Vulnerable Workers" comes out on March 20, and in it, she writes about spending time in some of these "dark" places where women have found strength despite grappling with sexual assault amid grinding poverty. As a reporter for the Center for Investigative Reporting's online platform, Reveal, Yeung has covered stories in immigrant communities and vulnerable populations -- those people often omitted from the recent nationwide reckoning on sexual harassment.

Yeung is among the many journalists who have covered sexual harassment in the workplace long before the #MeToo movement swept the country. For "In a Day's Work," Yeung followed the lives of "invisible workers" -- the women who pick our food, mop our floors and clean our bathrooms.

Yeung began working with a documentary team in 2011 to report on sexual harassment and assault the in agriculture industry, shown in 2013's "Rape in the Fields," and in custodial work, as seen in the 2015 film "Rape on the Night Shift."

Related: 2017 was the year of (certain) women's voices

Documentary filmmaker and Berkeley journalism professor Andrés Cediel first met Yeung when they began working together on "Rape in the Fields." Cediel and Yeung tackled a sexual assault story together after a former Berkeley student revealed a devastating secret from a female agricultural worker she interviewed: the field foreman raped her and many other workers, all of them terrified to speak up for fear of deportation or retaliation.

When Yeung and Cediel started reporting on the story, Cediel noticed Yeung's determination to do the work: to track alleged rapists, build databases, find sources and knock on trailer park doors.

"There's this willingness in her to not even pound the pavement, but to pound the dirt road," Cediel said. "To be out in these far-flung communities, to go talk to people nobody else is going to bother to talk to."

Yeung admits that the lack of interest in stories about "invisible workers" has been a "barrier" in her reporting process. Part of the challenge is technical --"how do we get access to them?" -- but it's also part of a bigger problem -- "Will people listen to these stories?"

"[People say] 'Do we really care?' They're not politically powerful ... they might not be the people one might even think about," she says. "Media has a huge role to play."

Almost five years after Yeung and her team produced "Rape in the Fields," bombshell investigations exposed sexual harassment in politics, media, entertainment and other industries.

Related: Why the data on sexual harassment is "just the tip of the iceberg"

To Yeung, this moment looks different, and not just because of policy changes or celebrity buy-in through the Time's Up initiative, which was created to help vulnerable women in Hollywood and beyond. She says that it's the sheer number of women coming forward to share their stories -- and pave a road for others to do the same -- that makes this moment feel like a true reckoning.

Recently, her documentaries were translated to Spanish and distributed via local community organizations to empower harassment victims.

"They got so pumped up," she said. "For them, they said it helped legitimize the problems they were dealing with."

Yeung says she celebrates the progress that came with the #MeToo movement — but she also knows it will take time for the ripple effects to reach the low-wage, undocumented and immigrant workers she interviews.

"There's also so many structural issues to women coming forward," she said. "There's so many steps that make it hard to say, 'Me, too.'"

In her dedication to "In a Day's Work," Yeung remembered them, too: To the women who shared their stories with us, and to those who couldn't.

Abby Ringquist is a US Olympic ski jumper who made her Olympic debut at the XXIII Winter Games in PyeongChang, South Korea. The opinions in this article belong to her.

It was 2002, I was 12 years old, and the Olympics were in my hometown: Park City, Utah. My eyes were glued to the ski jumpers. But it did not occur to me that there were no women competing in the events.

Women had been petitioning the International Olympic Committee to qualify and compete in the ski jumping events for years, but the sport was restricted to men.

But when all you've ever dreamed of is competing in the Olympics, nothing will stand in your way. So I trained, campaigned and fought. And nine years later, the IOC acquiesced.

Related: U.S. Olympic athletes sure aren't paid like champions

Still, the battle for gender equality was far from over. Just because women were now allowed to compete in Olympic ski jumping didn't mean they could afford to.

To make it to the qualifying events for the 2014 Sochi games in Russia, my family shed a lot of cash. I mean, a lot of cash. Thousands upon thousands of dollars.

At elite levels of all sports, it's not uncommon for families to spend more than $20,000 per year. While funding and prize money are out there, that money disproportionately benefits male athletes.

Take the FIFA World Cup. In 2015, the US Women's National Team took home $2 million for winning the World Cup, while Germany's men's team took home $35 million for winning the 2014 World Cup. The US men's team finished in 11th place in 2014 with $9 million — four times as much as the 2015 women's championship team.

Even when I thought I'd reach a point in my career where I'd finally have access to funding, I was informed that some funding for the US Women's Ski Jumping team had fallen through. Only the top three women on the team would receive money. So, unless I performed the next competition at the highest possible level, I would be cut off for the rest of the season.

I felt like I had face-planted into icy snow. The money should have been there. Yet it wasn't. And there was no way I could continue to pursue this goal without a miraculously fuller checking account.

Related: Why sponsors are breaking up with the Olympics

So, still training full-time, I got a job. And another one. And a third one. I coached the junior jumpers — local preteen girls with their own competition dreams. I worked at Habitat for Humanity and served at a cafe. Every last penny from those three jobs went into traveling to compete.

Qualifying for the Olympics isn't just about talent and skill and dedication. It's also — sometimes even more so — about money.

The financial obligation starts when athletes are young. About one in three parents from households making less than $50,000 a year had to pull their child out of sports because the cost was just too high, according to a study by Harvard University and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

While athletic opportunities have increased for high schoolers, a University of Michigan study found that opportunities for boys have grown more than those for girls.

That's an issue, because just like boys, girls need sports. Not only do sports offer physical benefits, but according to the Women's Sports Foundation, girls and women who play sports also have higher levels of confidence and self-esteem and lower levels of depression. Plus, high school girls who play sports are more likely to graduate.

In short, sports change lives. This was most evident to me this February at the PyeongChang games, 16 years after watching those ski jumpers in Park City. At 28, I achieved my ultimate goal of becoming an Olympian, and I did not need to medal to know that I'd made it. But what now?

I'm done. I can no longer continue to fund another Olympic pursuit.

Even while putting three separate paychecks toward ski jumping, I barely scraped by. If it weren't for additional funding through organizations like 1,000 Dreams Fund, which supported my journey last fall, I don't know if I could have made it all the way to the Olympics.

If we want young girls to reap the immeasurable benefits of sports — just as boys do — competitive sports need to be financially accessible.

So, let's get the girls out onto the playing field. I've achieved my Olympic dream. Now I want to see more girls achieve theirs.

Statehouses Have A Ways To Go To Accommodate New Moms

For Kathy Tran, the decision to breastfeed her daughter on the floor of the Virginia House of Delegates was simple.

"I had a baby that was hungry and I needed to feed her," Tran says.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Sarah McCammon/NPR Sarah McCammon/NPR

Tran is by all accounts the first Virginia state delegate to breastfeed on the floor of the Virginia House of Delegates. Since taking office in January, she's been juggling daycare and feeding schedules around meetings and late-night votes. She often ducks her 13-month-old under a nursing cover and continues on with her business.

Tran has been a working mom before; her older three children stay in northern Virginia with her husband while she's in Richmond. She was elected in November 2017, in the first wave of women to run for office after President Trump's election.

Tran says she made the decision to run when her youngest was a month old.

"So she was with me throughout the entire campaign. We did a lot of door knocking together," Tran says.

Her colleague, Del. Jennifer Carroll Foy, learned she was pregnant two weeks after announcing her own candidacy in early 2017. She says she was motivated to oppose President Trump's agenda, and finding out she was expecting a baby – twins, as it turned out – did not deter her.

"I knew that, you know, no matter what I thought, no matter what I had going on, this was so important. Because there needed to be a response and counterbalance to what he was bringing to the table," Carroll Foy says.

Family and friends helped her campaign through a difficult pregnancy that included bed rest and preterm labor. Carroll Foy and her husband are now parenting two healthy baby boys while she travels about an hour between her district and Richmond.

"I was very disappointed to come down to the General Assembly and find that there aren't nursing rooms readily available," she says. "There aren't baby changing stations in the women's bathroom. We can't say that we want to be family-friendly, and that we want women to run for office and be successful and be great legislators when we're not doing things to help accommodate them as much as we possibly can."

Paul Nardo, Clerk of the Virginia House of Delegates, says he and others in charge of managing the grounds are looking at ways to accommodate young parents, especially nursing mothers. It's a slow process, he says; the House chamber didn't even have a women's restroom until a renovation completed in 2007.

The historic nature of the Virginia Capitol doesn't help.

"We're cramped for space in this office, to be honest, so having a dedicated room – everything's sort of spoken for, so we have to kind of retrofit and work around that," Nardo says.

For now, Nardo says two lactation rooms have been set aside in a nearby legislative office building.

"Having gone through the first session with this many women of child-bearing and –rearing ages, we're working through it," Nardo says.

While Democrats Tran and Carroll Foy are newcomers, other female lawmakers before them have had to navigate similar challenges, one at a time.

In 2008, Republican state Sen. Jill Vogel was the first Virginia state lawmaker to have a baby while in office. She remembers slipping away to pump breast milk, then sending it to her office with a Senate page.

"They had no idea what they were delivering," Vogel says with a laugh.

Vogel says the work culture around politics has lagged behind the private sector in accommodating working moms. She says she often gets asked how she can be both a mother of six and a legislator – a question her male colleagues are less likely to face.

"In a private sector job, you wouldn't think twice; you'd say 'Of course I can do both and be competent at both,'" she says. "So I didn't apologize."

State Sen. Jennifer McClellan, a Democrat, was a state delegate in 2010 when she had her first child. She asked to borrow an empty office when she needed to pump, and she now offers her own office to staffers, lobbyists, and any other new moms at the Capitol who might need a space to pump.

"I even made a sign that had a picture of a cow that said, 'Do not enter,'" McClellan says with a laugh. "And it was like, you know, don't ask questions when you see that, just don't come in."

McClellan says it's important to accommodate young mothers in politics, in part because of the perspectives they bring to issues like education and childcare.

"You get a different perspective once you are living that life." McClellan says.

It's a relatively new challenge; women have long been under-represented in elected office. It was just this year that the nation saw 25 percent of state legislative seats held by women.

Katie Ziegler, program manager for the Women's Legislative Network at the National Conference of State Legislatures, says women with children have historically waited to run until later in life.

"It has been much less common for women to run and serve with infants and toddlers," Ziegler says, "and we've seen that in how few state legislatures and capitol buildings have fully figured out how they will accommodate nursing mothers."

Ziegle says some capitol buildings are beginning to make accommodations, and more will need to do so as women are elected in greater numbers.

Multiple groups around the country are working to elect more women in the 2018 midterm elections.

Erin Loos Cutraro founded the nonpartisan group She Should Run, which is now part of a coalition dedicated to electing women of all stripes. She says bringing more women into public life will change both public policy and the workplace culture around politics.

"It's not terribly surprising that many of these conversations around how to make the governing workspace more welcoming to new moms are, 'That's a new conversation!'" she says. "But everything changes when we add women to the equation. We get a stronger democracy. We get stronger policies. And so I think we are absolutely going to have to change the way we do business."

That change includes the U.S. Capitol, where this spring Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., will be the first sitting senator to give birth in office. She says there's no precedent for maternity leave in the Senate, and that her situation illustrates the importance of having a full range of women's experiences reflected in the lives of those who represent them.

"I'm one person facing this here in the Senate," Duckworth told NPR. "But...there are women all across this country who are facing starting their families and there's no policy for them either – and they're not United States Senators and get the attention that I'm getting."

More Than Half Of Transgender Teachers Surveyed Tell NPR They Are Harassed At Work

Enlarge this image toggle caption NPR NPR

More than half of transgender teachers face harassment or discrimination in the workplace, according to an NPR Ed survey of transgender and gender-nonconforming educators.

The survey of 79 trans and gender-nonconforming teachers from the U.S. and Canada found that the harassment they face ranges widely: from 20 percent who reported verbal harassment, to 17 percent who said they'd been asked to change how the present themselves, such as their clothing, to two teachers who said they'd been fired.

"I was horribly harassed by a coworker and very little was done about it," said Lauren Heckathorne of Evanston, Ill., who identifies as nonbinary. "The focus was on making [the harasser] more comfortable."

These findings come from our online survey, and follow-up interviews by phone and in person with two dozen of the 79 teachers who responded.

Despite the challenges they face, a majority of these teachers also said they have tried to integrate LGBT-related topics into their teaching. Many also mentioned advising LGBT awareness groups for students, training peers or addressing the topic in venues such as school assemblies.

And, they told us, they see schools as crucial spaces not only of learning, but of safety, for the next generation.

"I don't think I've ever seen a supportive parent for my LGBT kids," says Chris Smith, who teaches many recent immigrants in a high school in New York City. Considering the high rates of bullying, homelessness and even suicide among LGBT youth, these teachers say their work can be a matter of life and death.

Forty percent of the teachers told us their students were more accepting of them than were the adults at school.

There is no way of knowing how representative our sample is of trans teachers around the country, nor how many trans and gender-nonconforming people may be working in schools to begin with. (A 2016 UCLA analysis put the percentage of trans adults in the U.S. as a whole at about 0.6 percent, or 1.4 million individuals.)

With those caveats firmly in mind, these educators gave us a candid glimpse into their lives.

56 percent reported some form of workplace discrimination or harassment. Primarily this came from the administration or colleagues, not from students.

62 percent said they have tried to integrate LGBT-related topics into their teaching.

71 percent said they were out about their identities at work.

Our respondents skewed young; 38 percent are under 30. And many are fairly new to teaching: 37 percent have been at it less than five years.

73 percent teach in public schools, meaning more are in private schools compared with the general population of teachers. Just one teacher reported teaching in a parochial school.

56 percent teach high school — a much higher number than the general population of teachers.

Our respondents came from 17 states, Washington, D.C., and Canada. Small towns and big cities were represented, but New York City led the list with 13 respondents.

Only 11 out of 69 who answered a question about their gender identity, or 15 percent of respondents, said that they were female, femme or a woman (see below for a discussion of this terminology). This is interesting in light of the fact that teaching, especially in lower grades, is one of the most gender-segregated professions in the United States — overwhelmingly, teaching jobs are held by women.

More than half, 53 percent, used a word related to "male" to describe their gender identity.

21 percent did not use a word related to one gender — for example, transgender, nonbinary, gender queer, gender fluid.

How they identify

Our respondents used a wide variety of words to describe their identities. For some, simply "male" or "female" fits.

"I identify as a guy," wrote a teacher in Omaha, Neb. who did not want his name used.

Others chose terms like trans man, trans woman, trans femme, FTM (female to male), nonbinary, gender queer, or genderfluid. They may use the pronouns "he" "she" or "they."

While "transgender" includes people whose gender identity is different from the sex they were assigned at birth, gender nonconforming is a broader umbrella term. As defined by one advocacy group, the Sylvia Rivera Law Project, it includes "people who do not follow other people's ideas or stereotypes about how they should look or act based on the female or male sex they were assigned at birth." None of these terms necessarily refers to sexual orientation; trans people may identify as gay, straight, bisexual, asexual or queer, to name a few possibilities.

Cisgender, meanwhile, is the term used to refer to people whose gender identity does agree with their sex assigned at birth.

Coming out

Now let's take a deeper dive into two related topics: being out, and the repercussions of that.

Most of our respondents, more than 7 in 10, said they were out at work.

But being "out" can take many forms, from telling a few trusted colleagues to making a public announcement.

Coming out is complex for trans and gender nonconforming people, they told us. They have different degrees of "passing privilege," which can be a function of the resources available for hormones, surgery, hair or makeup, or simply personal choice.

"I pass as male and work as male," wrote Cuthbert, who did not want their last name used. "None of my current students know I am trans."

For others, "I come out when I walk into a room, or at least when I open my mouth," as Alaina Daniels, a high school science teacher in New York City, told us in an interview.

Sam Long, a science teacher in Denver, Colo., said that their administration initially pushed back on the idea of their coming out, but, "eventually I did come out to students and it had a very positive impact on the community. We had several students open up about their orientation and one student come out as genderqueer. I was glad to have made those students feel safe enough to share."

Teachers in our survey reported being most likely to be out to colleagues, and least likely to have informed their students' parents.

Workplace discrimination

For many trans teachers, coming out carries risks. The National Center for Transgender Equality lists only 15 states that explicitly prohibit, by law, discrimination on the basis of gender identity. Most of our respondents reported some form of workplace discrimination or harassment, whether from the administration, colleagues, or less frequently, students.

Here are some of their stories:

"I am the only out trans employee in my district and there are not the necessary protocols in place to keep me safe," said Lauren Heckathorne in Illinois.

"One colleague thought 'tr*nny' was the correct term to use when referring to trans people," Logan Keane, a high school teacher in New York City, told us.

"I am often subject to verbal abuse in the hallways and have been prevented from accessing the teacher's lounge by colleagues," said Jennifer Eller, an educator in Maryland. "The ... administration transferred me to a conservative area and gave me increasingly more difficult student populations to work with in hopes that I would resign my position. When that failed, they began misgendering me in front of others and disciplining me for correcting them."

Misgendering, or being called by the wrong pronoun, is one of the most common forms of verbal harassment mentioned by our survey respondents.

Several trans people emphasized in conversations with this cis woman reporter that what might seem like a small mistake or an innocent slip of the tongue —calling someone by a different pronoun than the one they request — in fact has a painful impact that builds up over time. And sometimes it's less inadvertent and more a clear expression of hostility, they said.

Chris Smith in New York, who uses "they," is tired of "the cliche response," from colleagues they call otherwise generally supportive: " 'Well, you've got to give me some time.' "

Smith's response? "Try, it's actually not that hard. We learn new groups of students' names each semester — there should be no excuse."

'Daily discrimination'

The second most commonly mentioned form of harassment, after verbal barbs, was being told to change how they presented themselves.

Rochelle, who asked us to use their first name, said they were genderfluid. They described leaving teaching over a decade ago because they felt the need to wear "work drag" such as neutral colors.

"I wonder if I were to teach now whether I could express my fluidity more fully. I have been experimenting with it at my current job (education administration, so public school system, but I don't interact with parents or students), and so far I feel safe. I think the times have changed."

Others mentioned moving schools, or states, or leaving the profession altogether.

"The treatment I received from past administrators ... impacted me so negatively that I almost quit the profession," Donnie, a civics and history teacher, who asked us to use their first name to protect their privacy, said. "Thankfully, I found a much better school."

"Before I taught in Washington State I experienced disrespect and discrimination from colleagues, administrators, and parents during five years teaching in Texas and North Carolina," said McKinley Morrison, now a pre-K teacher in Olympia, Wash.

"I'm leaving teaching because I can't be an effective educator and deal with daily discrimination at the same time. I've been on long-term med leave because of PTSD/depression from several specific events and many daily aggressions," a middle school math and science teacher in the Midwest, who did not want their name used, wrote.

Still other trans teachers said they don't feel safe transitioning in the first place.

"I'm not out yet at all, and not in transition because in Indiana I have no legal protections, and I am the provider in my household," said another teacher who did not want their name used. "I need to keep my job so I can eat, pay off student loans, pay rent, etc. I don't know when it will be safe to come out, for me. I don't know if I'll ever feel comfortable being trans at work."

"No one knows about me and I would like for you to keep this in the strictest confidential," said a third teacher who also requested anonymity.

Despite these negative experiences, there were bright spots. As noted above, 40 percent of our respondents said their students were more accepting of them than others at school.

Some said they felt times have changed, with people more understanding and accepting than they were even a few years ago.

"I would not have been comfortable being out with my students during my first few years of teaching, mostly because mainstream cultural understandings of trans topics was much, much lower," Lewis Maday-Travis, who teaches eighth-grade human biology and health in Seattle, told us.

And despite all the difficulties they noted, many of these educators expressed a deep sense of mission. Whether they work with special needs students or English language learners, teenagers or young children, they are also role models.

Many said they felt they play a vital — even life-saving — role through their visibility. Sometimes in surprising ways.

Like Chris Smith, who teaches mostly recent immigrant students at a public high school in New York City. They asked their students to call them Teacher Smith. "A former student was involved in sex work previously. He'd never been tested, didn't know what HIV was," Smith said. "And he opened up to me because he was comfortable about it."

It wasn't necessarily directly related to gender identity, but, Smith says, "I have noticed a lot of social responsibility in trans and [gender nonconforming] communities. It's a value that has a strong current in our community. Maybe because we were the folks who needed it the most growing up."

PlayStation 4's latest update gives parents a lot more power.

On Wednesday, Sony (SNE) rolled out a PS4 software update for its gaming console with several new features -- most notably, the ability for adults to restrict how long a child uses the system.

Other new features include more personalization and improved image quality for games played on HDTVs.

Adults can now keep track and control the length of PS4 playtime for children. It's possible to set up certain hours when playing is allowed -- like 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. on weekends -- and automatically log out the user when time is up.

Related: Game on: Video game consoles are flying off shelves again

The new parental control feature earned praise from Chris Byrne, content director at review site TTPM.com, which stands for toys, tots, pets and more.

"Parents today are really trying to limit screen time for kids and contextualize it. This is a really nice, strong feature for parents," he told CNN.

Nintendo Switch -- one part mobile, one part home console -- already has a similar feature.

Launched in 2013, PlayStation 4 has been a big hit for Sony. It has sold over 70.6 million units worldwide as of December 2017.

The software update comes amid increased competition from brands such as Xbox and Nintendo. The one-year-old Nintendo Switch console sold more units over its first ten months than any other console ever. But the PS4 remains the current market leader.

For PS4 players, some games will look better. With the new "supersampling mode," games that render to a higher resolution on a 4K TV will downscale to match the HDTV. This will create a better image clarity without requiring a 4K TV.

The update also brings more personalization to the console, such as the ability to upload your own photos and set them as your wallpaper. New tabs make it easier to see what's been recently installed and purchased, and there's also a custom friends list that shows who's online.

Related: The CEO who saved Sony is stepping down

While this particular update may not be a game changer, it shows customers the company is continuing to improve the console over time, according to Mat Piscatella, a games industry analyst at NPD.

A bigger draw is the PlayStation 4's huge library of games, including best-selling titles such as "Call of Duty" and "Madden," and content exclusively available on the PS4, including "Bloodborne" and "Horizon: Zero Dawn."

"Sony has also done a masterful job in promoting the console and in bringing new ways to play to PlayStation 4, such as PlayStation VR," Piscatella said.

West Virginia teachers and politicians have come to an agreement to end a nine-day strike over demands for higher wages, better benefits and increased incentives to help fill the roughly 700 teaching vacancies in the state.

West Virginia Governor James Justice II said on Tuesday morning the tentative agreement will allow for the five percent pay increase teachers demanded. The money will come from budget cuts from his staff.

The bill passed the West Virginia Senate by a vote of 98 to one. Republicans in the Senate said it would entail "reduced government", one of their legislative goals.

The bill still needs to pass the lower house of the West Virginia legislature, the House of Delegates.

'Real winners are students'

Leaders from the three unions representing teachers gathered outside the state senate to address a crowd of hundreds of teachers and activists rallying to pressure the state legislator to pass a bill that would put teachers back in the classroom.

"You have had a victory … but the real winners of all of this are the students of West Virginia. We're making an investment in their future by investing in education," West Virginia Education Association President Dale Lee said to the crowd.

{articleGUID}

West Virginia teachers walked out of the classroom last week after months of negotiations over wages and benefits.

All schools in the state have been closed since February 22. It was the first teachers' strike in West Virginia since 1990.

West Virginia employs around 20,000 teachers.

The community rallied around both teachers and students. Food banks were opened to make sure students who depended on school-provided meals during the day would not go hungry.

Lee thanked the community and asked them to express gratitude to Justice for "making an investment in West Virginia".

In 1976, The New Yorker published a cover illustration by Saul Steinberg called "View of the World from 9th Avenue." The cover was meant to parody the self-obsession of Manhattanites. The island's west side occupies half of the illustration. In the distance are a smattering of indistinguishable American cities and states. Los Angeles is barely visible; San Francisco and Seattle aren't on the map. Beyond is the vast Pacific, with Asia on the horizon.

More than four decades later, the American news media still has that worldview. Nearly all the top news organizations are based in New York or Washington. They do cover the world -- including Silicon Valley and Hollywood -- but they prioritize the stories happening on their doorsteps.

Sign up for PACIFIC and get daily updates on the stories you need to know

But one of the most important stories in the world today isn't happening in Washington or on Wall Street. It's happening on the Pacific Coast.

From Seattle to Silicon Valley to Hollywood, the Pacific is the global capital of change and innovation, and the vanguard of a creative and technological revolution. It also happens to be the world's fifth-biggest economy, and home to its five biggest companies by market value. Decisions being made today by the likes of Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and other people on the U.S.' West Coast will play a major role in shaping society for decades to come. And on the other Pacific Coast, companies in China, Japan and elsewhere are charting a course for the future that will have global impact of its own.

The Innovation Economy deserves robust media coverage. It deserves a news source that distills the day-to-day developments in technology and media and provides an understanding of the big picture. It deserves a great morning newsletter that puts the tech and media power players at the center of the action. Wall Street has DealBook. Washington has Playbook. It's about time the West Coast had PACIFIC.

PACIFIC is the newsletter for the Innovation Economy. It puts the power players in tech and media at the center of the action, and covers their moves and their interests, because those moves and interests signal where society is headed.

U.S. Forest Service Chief Resigns Amid Sexual Misconduct Allegations

toggle caption U.S. Forest Serivce

Tony Tooke, the head of the U.S. Forest Service, resigned on Wednesday following accusations of sexual harassment.

The resignation was effective immediately, and came days after PBS NewsHour reported that the U.S. Agriculture Department was investigating sexual misconduct complaints against him.

The NewsHour report revealed a widespread culture of sexual harassment and assault within the agency, and retaliation against those who reported it.

At least 34 women talked to PBS and revealed widespread misconduct including reports of rape.

The Department of Agriculture confirmed last week to PBS that it had "engaged an independent investigator" to look into claims about Tooke's behavior.

In an email to employees, Tooke wrote it was time for a "new leader."

"In some of these news reports, you may have seen references to my own behavior in the past. This naturally raised questions about my record and prompted an investigation, which I requested and fully support, and with which I have cooperated. I have been forthright during the review, but I cannot combat every inaccuracy that is reported in the news media. "What I can control, however, are decisions I make today and the choice of a path for the future that is best for our employees, the Forest Service and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. I must also think about what is best for my family. Therefore, I have decided that what is needed right now is for me to step down as Forest Service Chief and make way for a new leader that can ensure future success for all employees and the agency."

The nature of the accusations against Tooke have not been made public.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced in August that Tooke would be the new chief of the Forest Service, which manages 154 national forests and 20 grasslands.

Tooke, who began working at the agency when he was 18 years old, spent about six months as its chief.

President Trump's proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum has sent shock waves around the world, but they've lit a fire under small stocks.

The Russell 2000, the top index for companies that have market values much lower than the giants of the Dow and S&P 500, is up 2% so far in March. And it's jumped nearly 4% in just the past five days alone.

Meanwhile, the Dow, home to giant U.S. multinational firms like Caterpillar (CAT), Boeing (BA), McDonald's (MCD) and Coca-Cola (KO), has fallen 3% so far in March. The recent small cap rally has even pushed the Russell 2000 slightly ahead of the S&P 500 for the year.

Investors are betting that a more protectionist stance by Trump -- and possible retaliatory tariffs from America's trading partners -- may hurt conglomerates but boost smaller companies with a more domestic focus.

Consider this: Shares of Caterpillar, which generated nearly 60% of its overall sales outside of the US in 2017 and has a market value of $90 billion, are down more than 6% this month.

But shares of H&E Equipment Services (HEES), a Baton Rouge-based company that rents construction equipment and generated nearly all of its revenue from the US last year, has surged 9% in March.

"It's obviously the tariffs," said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist with LPL Financial, to explain why smaller companies are doing so well in the past few days. "This could just be the start of them outperforming the broader market."

Detrick said there are other reasons investors favor smaller companies. For example, they should benefit more from tax reform since many smaller companies have historically paid higher corporate tax rates than larger firms.

Kurt Spieler, CIO of wealth management for First National Bank of Omaha, said the solid economic growth in the United States is also good news for smaller companies.

Small firms should be able to report better profits than larger companies -- and that should justify higher stock prices.

"The higher percentage of revenue from the US is leading to faster earnings growth for small caps," Spieler said. "The outlook for them is less about the benefits of not being part of a trade war than it is liking the fundamentals."

Spieler said he particularly likes smaller tech, financial and industrial companies because they should benefit the most from a continued economic expansion.

Dave Harden, CIO and president of Summit Global Investments, also thinks smaller companies look attractive thanks to their growth expectations. But he cautions that not even smaller domestic-focused companies will be immune to more volatility in Washington.

"I like small cap companies. I really do. There are some great names out there," Harden said. "But the biggest risk I see for the market today is the White House. Whether it's good or bad, it all comes down to Washington."

Disney’s $100 million gamble to turn the classic children’s book “A Wrinkle in Time” into a politically correct film filled with liberal talking points on feminism and diversity may be backfiring badly, with the poorly reviewed Oprah Winfrey-starring movie possibly teetering toward a tank job at the box office this weekend, according to some predictions.

The film is currently rated a “rotten” 43 percent on “Rotten Tomatoes,” but “woke” cultural critics don’t seem to mind. They say that the movie, directed by anti-Trump filmmaker Ava DuVernay, is so important in terms of its social justice messages that whether it’s a terrible movie or not just doesn’t matter.

Parade Magazine said the film is a “crinkled, jammed, over-crammed hot mess,” but praised the casting of Hollywood's favorite 2020 presidential possibility.

“There’s 20-foot Oprah, and what she represents in America as a self-made black billionaire, media mogul, philanthropist, and a living symbol of survival and success. She radiates empowerment—even when, later in the film, her character ‘shrinks’ down to regular size,” Parade’s Neil Pond wrote.

Madeline L’Engle’s science fantasy novel “A Wrinkle in Time” was published in 1962 and is considered a literary classic. DuVernay’s aggressively uplifting version of the dark, sophisticated novel is far from a straight adaptation, and the obvious differences are deliberate -- at least when it comes to the appearance of several main characters.

“I just wanted a cast that reflects the real world,” DuVernay told CinemaBlend.

The movie’s main character, Meg Murray, is described in the novel as a redheaded girl, but DuVernay cast African-American actress Storm Reid. DuVernay’s Meg is supposed to be biracial, with a white father (played by “Star Trek” actor Chris Pine) and a black mother (played by “Black Mirror" actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw).

DuVernay, who directed the civil rights film "Selma," told the New York Times she selected Australian actor Levi Miller to play Meg’s friend “because that was so powerful, to show a white boy following a black girl” throughout the movie.

“The diversity of its cast is both a welcome innovation and the declaration of a new norm,” the New York Times’ A.O. Scott wrote.

The Federalist applied a more critical eye, with writer James Dawson calling the film “the latest victim of diversity-deranged stunt casting in which no respect is paid to the race or sex of existing literary characters. But that's only one reason why this frustrating fiasco is such an embarrassing failure.”

The film is often billed as “the first $100 million movie directed by an African-American woman,” and DuVernay, who’s well known for her Twitter attacks on President Trump, doesn’t seem to mind if it bombs at the box office.

“I don’t care what anybody thinks about it,” she told the Times. “I know it’s $100 million for the studio. They’ll be fine.”

That’s would be a first for the famously parsimonious Walt Disney Company. According to the New York Observer, "Long-range forecasts initially pegged A Wrinkle in Time for a good-not-great opening between $50 million and $80 million, but now that number has slumped to around $35 million. With a budget north of $100 million and a strong marketing push from the Mouse House, that would be dangerously close to flop territory.”

It would be a rare and painfully expensive misfire for Disney, which has enjoyed a succession of hits by turning beloved fairy tales and children’s books into live action movies such as “The Jungle Book” and “Beauty and the Beast."

(Fox News’ owner, 21st Century Fox, has announced plans to sell its movie assets to Disney should it receive government approval).

It doesn’t help that “A Wrinkle in Time” must compete with “Black Panther,” which in addition to being acclaimed for featuring an overwhelmingly black cast has also gotten stellar reviews just for being a great movie.

As for a “Wrinkle in Time,” cultural critics are trying to look away from the movie's problems and instead fawn over its politicized message. Marie Claire published a headline, “’A Wrinkle in Time’ isn’t a great movie, but that’s completely irrelevant.”

The review by Yolanda Machado features the quote, “Because of this film, my daughter will never question that she can be strong.”

Free Beacon reporter Alex Griswold noticed this has become a common theme, writing that, “If you want insight into why early handpicked reviews for movies are often useless, consider how obviously these reviewers are incapable of saying they thought the movie sucked,” with screen grabs of several similar assessments.

Griswold added, “Even the people out there admitting ‘yeah the movie sucks’ have to go out of their way to talk about how great the people who made it are.”

One reviewer called it a “big bold beautiful mess” before praising DuVernay for “swinging for the fences” with a “not great” script, while another said it “has its flaws” but they’re “secondary to its genuine ambition and earned emotion.”

The Daily Texan added that "the film quickly goes from cringeworthy to crowd pleasing."

Ironically, early reviews based on a trailer were glowing with words such as “gorgeous” used to describe the film lauded as an example of Disney “looking forward, not backward.” However, once critics actually saw “A Wrinkle in Time,” most of the acclaim revolved around risk taking and social justice issues.

“There are few contemporary directors who have been more willing to explore profound social wounds than DuVernay,” NPR’s Linda Holmes wrote.

It seems that DuVernay -- whose Oscar nominated documentary “13th” took a hard-hitting look at the high rate of incarceration for African-Americans -- cares more about advancing social issues than making money for Disney.

"This is a happy movie in a dark time, which is particularly important for young kids, especially young regular girls. They need to know that they can be recognized for just being themselves, they don't have to be Jedis or superheroes," DuVernay recently said, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

“A Wrinkle in Time” hits theaters March 9, with certain theaters showing it on March 8.

America's Oil Boom Is Fueled By A Tech Boom

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mose Buchele/KUT Mose Buchele/KUT

The U.S. is on track to become the world's biggest oil producer, pumping out more crude than at its peak nearly a half century ago. For decades, few expected such a comeback, and it's all the more remarkable because the price of a barrel of oil is nowhere near what it was during the last, recent boom.

"This is an incredible statement, but we're probably making more money at fifty dollars a barrel than a hundred," says Kirk Edwards, president of Latigo Petroleum in Midland, the de facto oil capitol of West Texas.

Downtown, not far from Edwards' office, a big LED sign flashes the going price of a barrel of oil. A few years ago, when the number was over 100, rigs were going up everywhere across the state's Permian Basin, as drillers made crazy money. Then came a crash, courtesy of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

"OPEC was trying their best just to slam the door on what was going on here by flooding the oil markets," says Edwards. "They did a phenomenal job."

Companies went bankrupt and hundreds of thousands of people lost jobs. In Midland, some laid off workers abandoned cars at the airport as they flew back home. People started to wonder if the good times would ever come back.

They have, even though the price of oil is nowhere near its old high.

Breaking Even When Oil Is Cheaper

One reason for that is a lower cost of doing business. Oilfield contractors who survived the bust did so by slashing prices. Subcontractors, of which there are many, started charging less.

Edwards says that significantly brought down the investment needed to drill a well. The head of ConocoPhillips has even boasted that his company can now break even when the price of oil is below $40 a barrel.

Technological advances in the way oil and gas is sucked from the ground are also helping producers cut costs.

The flat, khaki-colored plains outside Midland are crowded again with rigs and pump jacks. Tommy Taylor of Fasken Oil and Ranch shows me a fracking operation where water, sand and chemicals are injected into the earth to separate oil from rock. Inside an air conditioned control center, called a frack van, men can monitor information coming out of the well.

"Look at all the computer screens," Taylor says. "We used to frack jobs on the tailgate of a pickup, and so we've come a long ways."

Fracking has been around for years, but companies have managed to continually increase its speed and efficiency, a trend sometimes referred to as "fracking 2.0." Plus, Taylor says, companies are getting more oil than they used to thanks to expanded use of horizontal drilling. That means drilling down, through layers of oil rich shale formation, and then drilling across, sometimes for miles.

"So there's oil and gas in the ground that we never thought we'd be able to access," says Taylor. "It's just phenomenal."

From Roughnecks To Robots

Another big change is automation. At the Permian Basin Petroleum Museum in Midland, facilities manager James White demonstrates an early engine for powering a pumpjack, called the "Johnny Popper." He grabs a huge wheel and spins it to get the machine working, as it emits a staccato string of pop sounds.

But today, "guys don't have to get into pickups and drive out to their pump jacks everyday like they used to," he says. Modern technology does it. "That's cool," he adds. "It just puts people out of work."

Those with the brawn and skill to do the dangerous work of drilling wells and putting pipe down them are called roughnecks. But more of them are being replaced with a robot, called an 'iron roughneck.' Companies are also turning to drones, smart drill bits, even autonomous rigs that can drill an oil well on their own.

"If you see those in operation that is definitely an 'oh wow' moment," says Eric van Oort, of the University of Texas at Austin.

He says automation is making oil fields safer. And "we are creating much more sophisticated, higher end jobs in the process," he says. He runs a lab where graduate students can analyze oil wells remotely, then advise companies on how to improve their operations.

But all this technological change has a cost.

Even as the US produces more oil than ever before, the Labor Department finds 50,000 fewer people working in oil and gas extraction than at the height of the last boom.

At a diner in Midland, R.T. Hale worries his machine shop is fast becoming obsolete. He's repaired oilfield equipment for 47 years. But "my machines were made in the U.S. They've all went out of business," he says. "Things I used to repair, they throw it away and stick a new one on it."

Even those prospering in the current oil boom aren't taking it for granted. At Midland's Petroleum Club, Jim Henry, CEO of Henry Resources, pauses to chat before sitting down to a filet mignon lunch.

"It's a high now," he laughs. "It's fun. Everybody's making money."

But Henry says America's new position as global oil king won't stop the eventual busts. In fact, he thinks the massive amount of production might even accelerate the industry's highs and lows. Drilling so much can push down prices, causing operators to pull back, an endless cycle that seems to be speeding up. "It'll be hard to keep up with," he says.
