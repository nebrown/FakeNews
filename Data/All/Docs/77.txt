Listen to America
We’re hitting the road on a 25-city tour to hear concerns from across the nation.

We want to know: What does it mean to be American today? To find out, we’re hitting the road this fall to interview people about their hopes, dreams, fears and definition of "being American." By converting a tour bus into a mobile video studio, we’ll capture conversations with people of all ages and backgrounds. Our goal: moving, multimedia storytelling that showcases what we share as Americans, rather than what divides us.

Why we are doing this

Trust in media has bottomed out. We hope to rebuild some of that — and learn from it — by listening to the public and elevating their stories through our massive distribution network.

How we are making it happen

We will travel the old-fashioned way — via bus — to 20-plus states to hear from some of the under-heard, diverse Americans who make up the communities that form much of our nation. And by working on the ground with community leaders, nonprofits, educational institutions, local businesses and others, we’ll make sure people know we’re there to listen.

Not on the bus tour? Don’t worry. You can follow us via our daily newsletter or Facebook page.

Plus, you can enter to win a $1,800 prize toward a trip to New Orleans for the Listen To America closing event. To enter, just tell us why you love your hometown.
