Elizabeth Warren: I’m Not Running For President in 2020
Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren stated in an interview Sunday that she is not going to run for president in 2020.

CNN’s Jim Acosta asked, “I have to ask you, because I cover the White House and I hear the president going after you from time to time referring to you as Pocahontas and speaking about your Native American heritage, does that get under your skin when he does that? And do you want to run for president in 2020?”

“I am not running for president in 2020,” Warren said.

She also talked about Trump referring to her as Pocahontas in the same interview, saying, “It’s about my family’s story because my family’s story is deeply apart of me and apart of my brothers.”
