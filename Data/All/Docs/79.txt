About Film

HuffPost UK Entertainment's Film page keeps on top of all the latest news in the movie industry – from Hollywood to Bollywood to Pinewood, from blockbuster franchises the size of Twilight and The Hobbit, to that obscure documentary with subtitles. We've been at red carpet ringside for the premiere of Harry Potter's final outing, and we've argued with James Cameron about whether Woody Allen should be making films in 3D just because it worked for Titanic. Whether you're an unashamedly nerdy student of the sequel, or just like looking at the dresses on Oscars night, we have something for everyone – including interviews with the hottest stars (yes, we asked Daniel Craig how he buffed up to play James Bond, and Mark Wahlberg told us how he knew who was going to win the Academy Awards), preview trailers, exclusive clips and video features of forthcoming films, competitions, and lots and lots of photos.
