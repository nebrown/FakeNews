Welcome to California, President Trump! Now skip the wall and let us educate you
I'd like Trump to know that in between his San Diego and Beverly Hills events, I'm available for a round of golf. I haven't hit a ball in years, so I might not offer much competition. But I can offer the perspective of someone who was born in California with grandparents from Spain and Italy, and has been told on many occasions to go back to Mexico. I can also explain to Trump why he got trounced in California by Hillary Clinton.
