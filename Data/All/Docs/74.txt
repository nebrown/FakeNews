'Love and Marriage in Mumbai'

In honor of Valentine's Day this week, a look at what happens AFTER you get married. Sam talks to PBS reporter and author Liz Flock about her new book, The Heart is a Shifting Sea: Love and Marriage in Mumbai. Liz spent about 10 years following three Indian couples in both love and arranged marriages. In a country that is rapidly changing, how do those changes impact marriage?
