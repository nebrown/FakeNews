PALM SPRINGS, Calif. — On Tuesday, President Trump will make his way to California, the first time he's visited the state since taking office more than a year ago.

Not since Dwight Eisenhower has a president failed to visit California before the end of his first year in office.

It makes sense, though, considering Trump doesn't seem to like some of the state's leaders and he vehemently objects to how California handles those who have immigrated to America illegally.

He has vowed to punish California for granting "sanctuary" status to illegal immigrants. And, just last week, he lashed out at the mayor of Oakland, calling her a "disgrace" for warning families before federal immigration agents raided their homes and places of employment.

Despite his negative feelings about California, Trump seems to be positive about inspecting the prototypes for his proposed border wall. He'll do that in San Diego, before heading north to Los Angeles.

There he'll attend a swanky Republican fundraiser in Beverly Hills. Tickets start at $35,000 and top out at $250,000, Los Angeles Times reports.

Since this trip a big deal for the president, the state and its citizens, here's a look at Trump's history with California:

1. This trip could be Stormy

When Trump touches down in California, he'll still be dealing with accusations of an affair with porn star Stormy Daniels.

Recently, Daniels (real name: Stephanie Clifford) filed a civil lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court contending that a non-disclosure agreement connected to an alleged 2006-07 affair she had with Trump is not binding because Trump did not sign it.

President Trump's longtime lawyer said Friday he used his home-equity line of credit to arrange a $130,000 payment to Daniels.

"The funds were taken from my home-equity line and transferred internally to my LLC account in the same bank," Michael Cohen told ABC News, as scrutiny intensified over the October 2016 deal.

In a statement earlier this year, Cohen said that neither the Trump campaign nor the Trump Organization was party to the agreement to pay off Daniels or reimbursed him for the payment. His statement was silent on whether Trump personally reimbursed him.

Before Daniels filed her recent lawsuit, the president had won a temporary restraining order against her. Nevertheless, Daniels sued Trump, while her attorney publicly claimed Daniels indeed had a sexual relationship with the president.

2. Beverly Hills went red

Despite his clash of ideas with liberal-minded Hollywood, Trump managed to win the vote against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in one Beverly Hills district, according to the Times. While the rest of Los Angeles' west side went decidedly blue, voters in the neighborhood surrounding the Beverly Hills Hotel — one of Trump's favorite hangouts — voted 54% in favor of the New York businessman.

3. Show him the money

While campaigning to become the president, Trump raised $2.9 million in Los Angeles, according to OpenSecrets.org. In Century City, the city adjacent to Beverly Hills, Trump's campaign brought in $400,000.

4. A course, of course

The Trump Organization operates a golf course in Southern California formerly known as the Ocean Trails Golf Club. After Ocean Trails lost half its 18th hole to a landslide into the Pacific Ocean and had other problems, Trump bought the luxury course in 2002, renaming it Trump National Golf Club — Los Angeles, the Times reported. The course on the Palos Verdes Peninsula is known for its spectacular views of the Pacific and glimpses of Catalina Island on clear days.

According to WorldGolf.com, "Trump National Golf Club — Los Angeles is the most expensive golf course ever built at $264 million. The 'Donald Trump signature' layout features white sand bunkers, expansive lakes, lavish waterfalls and awesome views of the Pacific Ocean."

5. Maples at Melvyn's

During a visit to the Coachella Valley in 1991, Trump ate dinner by candlelight with his then-fiancee, Marla Maples, at Melvyn's Restaurant in Palm Springs. One host remembers Trump acting differently than his larger-than-life persona of today. "He wasn't pretentious or demanding. He didn't push his weight around," he said. Two years later, Trump was back in the valley to participate in the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.

6. Prefers room service?

While Trump may not want to hang out in the Palm Springs area — unlike his predecessor Barack Obama did multiple times during his presidency — Trump doesn't seem to mind Beverly Hills. He owns a 5,395-square-foot mansion across from the Beverly Hills Hotel but has told magazines he prefers to stay at the hotel when visiting California.

7. Not feeling the windmills

Trump even dislikes California's infrastructure. Back in 2016, when Trump was running for president, he went on Herman Cain's radio show and declared that the windmills along Interstate 10 near Palm Springs were "the worst thing you've ever seen." He once described the windmills as "rusting and rotting" and said they made Palm Springs look like a "junkyard."

8. Another casino goes bust

Trump had a big plan for a casino in the city of Coachella. In 2001, Trump wanted to invest in Spotlight 29, a bingo parlor run by the Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Mission Indians, a tribe of only 12 people. Spotlight 29 was the smallest casino in the Coachella Valley at the time, but Trump saw the potential for big money. Trump had the reputation and name to raise money for the casino. He became the casino's manager and Spotlight 29 became Trump 29 in 2002. But three years later, his multibillion-dollar resort company went bankrupt and his contract was later terminated for $6 million, less than the contract had earned him in a single year.
