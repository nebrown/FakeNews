Wearing a sheriff’s uniform with what appeared to be a gun strapped to his belt, the 14-year-old boy walked up to a Victorville home and told the resident he was investigating a report of a domestic disturbance.

After a brief exchange in which the homeowner told him there was no problem, the teen left.

Victorville police detectives learned that the suspect also initiated two other similar contacts Monday night, posing as a law enforcement officer. The boy, a probationer who was not named because of his age, was arrested Tuesday and booked at the High Desert Juvenile Detention Center.

The first incident occurred about 6 p.m. in the 13600 block of Mica Avenue. The teen, who was driving his great grandparent’s Ford Explorer, pulled into the driveway with red and blue emergency lights flashing, authorities said.

He wore a San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department uniform when he spoke with the homeowner. The resident reported the encounter to police.

Later that night, the teen allegedly stopped a woman on the road, took her information and let her go with a warning, police said. Authorities said he also pulled into another driveway, where he told a resident that he was investigating a disturbance call.

Detectives are still trying to find the latter two victims. Anyone with information can call Victorville police at (760) 241-2911.
