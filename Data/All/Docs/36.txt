President Trump’s former campaign manager pleaded not guilty Thursday after being hit with a second indictment that included fraud and tax-related charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller in Virginia.

Manafort’s longtime business associate and former Trump campaign aide, Rick Gates, pleaded guilty to lying to Mueller’s team last month.

Part of the plea that Gates, who also served on Trump’s transition team, accepted requires him to work with Mueller’s investigators.

Gates could turn out to be a key witness for investigators examining possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russian election meddling. Manafort, in both indictments, is accused of hiding work he did for Russian-linked politicians in Ukraine and hiding his payments in offshore accounts.

In Washington, he faces counts of conspiracy to launder more than $30 million, making false statements, failing to follow lobbying disclosure laws and working as an unregistered foreign agent.

Manafort also faces bank fraud charges in Virginia not directly related to his work in Ukraine.

After his business there dried up, according to prosecutors, Manafort fraudulently secured over $20 million in loans in part by using his real estate as collateral.

Manafort remains under house arrest. His D.C. trial is set to start in September.
