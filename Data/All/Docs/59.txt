Penguins Find Their Moment In The Spotlight With A Video 'Selfie'
Two emperor penguins in Antarctica have waddled their way into the international spotlight thanks to an unintentional video “selfie.”

The inquisitive creatures were captured on film investigating a camera left behind by the Australian Antarctic expeditioner Eddie Gault at the Auster Rookery.

“It didn’t take long for the naturally curious birds to seize the opportunity for a selfie,” the Australian Antarctic Division wrote in a Facebook post about the video.

In the brief footage, one particularly nosy bird walks over to the camera and kicks it so that the lens faces up, giving humans a view of the animals typically reserved for the birds’ prey, the Antarctic silverfish.
