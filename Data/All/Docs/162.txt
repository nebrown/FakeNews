CNN’s Bizarre Blackout On Democrats’ Farrakhan Scandal
CNN has refused to inform its audience of a growing scandal tying prominent Democratic politicians and activists to Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, a notorious racist and anti-Semite.

At least eight Democrats are known to have met with Farrakhan, who routinely calls Jews “satanic” and has said that white people “deserve to die.”

Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, the deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee, misled the public for years about his relationship with Farrakhan, new reporting has shown and The Washington Post has acknowledged.

Illinois Rep. Danny Davis, a Democrat, defended Farrakhan as an “outstanding human being” and admitted to having a personal relationship with him in a pair of interviews with this reporter. After a backlash, Davis reversed his position in a written statement, denouncing Farrakhan’s “views and remarks regarding the Jewish people and the Jewish religion.” (He previously said he wasn’t bothered by Farrakhan’s position on “the Jewish question.”)

Of the eight Democrats with ties to Farrakhan, four of them have repeatedly declined to denounce Farrakhan, despite outrage and pressure from Jewish groups.
