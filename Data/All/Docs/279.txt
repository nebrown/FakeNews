Sally Field for the win.

Because of the actress' masterful mom meddling, her son, filmmaker Sam Greisman, got to meet his crush, Adam Rippon.

Greisman shared with his 26,000-plus Twitter followers that he and the Olympic skater had crossed paths. And he knew exactly who deserved credit for the meeting.

"Thanks, mom," Greisman tweeted Saturday night, along with a photo of the two gents embracing.

Back in February, Greisman shared a screenshot of a conversation with his mother that he described as "some really helpful advice from my mom on how to deal with my Olympic crush." Though Greisman didn't identify the object of his affection, Field, who was clearly shipping the twosome, alerted Rippon to their convo by mentioning him on Twitter.

Rippon predicted the two would eventually meet in an interview with BuzzFeed in February. "Sam, your mom — I admire her. And I’m sure one day we’re going to meet. So thanks, mom."
