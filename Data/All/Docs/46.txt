Florida House passes gun-school safety bill
Politicians in the Florida House have passed a school safety bill that includes new restrictions on rifle sales and a programme to arm some teachers.

The measure, a response to the shooting at Parkland high school that left 17 dead last month, was supported by the victims' families.

The school safety bill has been sent to Florida's Governor Rick Scott for his signature. If he signs it, the bill becomes law within 15 days.

The proposals include raising the minimum age for buying rifles from 18 to 21.
