Former Clinton Adviser Philippe Reines Reacts to Trump Rally: ‘I Understand Why He May Win Again in 2020’
Jesse Watters’ Fox News show reacted to President Donald Trump’s marathon rally in Pennsylvania Saturday night, and Philippe Reines — a former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton — speculated about his 2020 chances.

Reines first noted that he didn’t enjoy the speech — which was very reminiscent of Trump’s 2016 campaign speeches — as much as fellow panelist David Bossie (a former Trump staffer.)

“I thought boy, does Donald Trump know how to keep an audience in the palm of his hands,” Reines noted. It actually is remarkable to watch.”

“I understand why that man won in 2016,” Reines added. “And I understand, though I’m not terrified, but I understand why he may win again in 2020.”

Reines, who was a senior adviser to Clinton at the State Department and advised her 2016 campaign, famously stood-in for Trump for her debate preparations.
