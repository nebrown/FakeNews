About Music

HuffPost UK Entertainment's Music page has no playlist, no agenda, no restrictions on what's hot, what's not. We simply bring you the latest news on all your favourite performing artists, and support this with videos, pictures and exclusive preview tracks. Have X Factor winners Little Mix got what it takes to be the next Girls Aloud? Here they both are with their latest sounds. Fancy a bit of American rock history? We've got an exclusive listen to Neil Young's latest homage to Bob Dylan. Need a Rolling Stones concert ticket? We can't afford one either, but we'll chart fans' outrage on Twitter. As well as celebrating the biggest sellers today – Ladies Gaga, Rihanna, Katy, we mean you – we have the space to be nostalgic, too. We've taken our camera to Abbey Road Studios, and remembered stars gone by like Andy Williams, Freddie Mercury and Robin Gibb, with their own dedicated playlists. It's not all chart-beaters and big record companies, though. If its good and it's on YouTube, we'll find it and bring it to you. After all, Gangnam Style had to start somewhere.
