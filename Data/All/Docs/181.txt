Togo D. West Jr., Clinton appointee who led Veterans Affairs and investigated Army abuses, dies at 75
"Under his leadership," Clinton said at the time, "the VA has begun to confront some long-neglected problems head on, reaching out to more than 400,000 veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange, pressing for answers to the Gulf War syndrome and proper care for those who suffer from it, beginning the process of building five new national cemeteries . . . and making a special effort to bring homeless veterans back into the society they did so much to defend."
