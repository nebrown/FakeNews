4 Men Stand Around While Woman Scrubs 'Happy International Women’s Day' From Steps
How many men does it take to make a female cleaner to scrub “Happy International Women’s Day” from the steps of the University of Oxford campus? Four, apparently.

In a tweet that went viral Thursday, a woman was captured scrubbing the words from the steps of Oxford’s Clarendon Building as women across the world celebrated International Women’s Day.

“What an image for #IWD,” tweeted Oxford professor Sophie Smith.
