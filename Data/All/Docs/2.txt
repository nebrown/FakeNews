In pictures: Amelia Earhart
US pilot Amelia Earhart was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic in 1932, and set a number of other aviation records.

She disappeared with her navigator, Captain Fred Noonan, in 1937 over the Pacific Ocean during an attempt to fly around the globe.

Earhart was born in Kansas in 1897. She started learning to fly some 24 years later.

A crowd cheered as she boarded her single-engine Lockheed Vega airplane in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, for a trip to London on 22 May 1932.

Earhart and Noonan first tried to fly around the would in 1924 - their plane is seen here over the Golden Gate Bridge near San Francisco. The trip had to be abandoned after the plane crashed on take-off in Hawaii.
