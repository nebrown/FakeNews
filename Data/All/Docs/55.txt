But on August 15, 2017, he may have hit the button a bit too quickly.From Trump Tower in New York, where he is spending a few days, the Republican leader retweeted a message from a man who called him a "fascist." It took him about 20 minutes to delete it.The man was replying to a Fox News tweet about the possibility that Trump could issue a pardon to Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff who has courted controversy -- and earned a conviction -- over his tough stance on immigrants. / AFP PHOTO / MANDEL NGAN
