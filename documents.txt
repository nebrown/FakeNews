Believe us, you need to try this.'), (1, '(CNN) An Ohio court will decide the fate of a transgender teen who is in what the judge describes as a "gut-wrenching situation."\n\nThe 17-year-old identifies as a boy. Neither he nor his family can be named, according to court instructions. The teen\'s parents want court authority to stop their child from getting the treatment and therapy that was recommended by his medical team in what it characterizes as a possible life-or-death situation.\n\nMedical experts testified that the father\'s ongoing refusal to call the child by his chosen name and the parents\' rejection of the teen\'s gender identity have triggered suicidal feelings.\n\nThe teen was hospitalized in 2016. He has been diagnosed with depression, an anxiety disorder and gender dysphoria , according to court records. Gender dysphoria is a psychiatric diagnosis the American Psychiatric Association defines as "a conflict between a person\'s physical or assigned gender and the gender with which he/she/they identify."\n\nThe teen is in the temporary legal custody of Hamilton County Job and Family Services and lives with his maternal grandparents, who want custody and are supportive of the teen\'s gender identity. He wants to stay with them.\n\nThe teen\'s court-appointed guardian believes that the grandparents, not the parents, should have custody and says they are best suited to help the child.\n\nThe medical team from Cincinnati Children\'s Hospital Medical Center , where the child had been in treatment, testified that the teen is improving mentally and emotionally through therapy and because his grandparents have created a supportive environment. However, they believe the teen should start treatment as soon as possible to decrease his suicide risk.\n\nAccording to a transcript of closing arguments, the grandparents said they are prepared to make medical decisions with the child, which may include starting hormone therapy.\n\n"We think the grandparents are the ones who have an open mind and will ... make this sort of decision best for the child," argued attorney Paul Hunt, who represents the guardian ad litem, or the child\'s court-appointed guardian. "The parents have clearly indicated that they\'re not open to it."\n\nThe teen\'s parents did not respond to CNN\'s request for comment.\n\nBut in her written closing argument, their attorney, Karen Brinkman, argued that the parents maintain that they love their child and said that the child\'s mother said the child has "nothing to fear" from her and that she wants to have a relationship with her child. She also acknowledged that if the parents are granted custody, they want the child to continue to live with the maternal grandparents, "not in an effort to avoid parenting their child, but because they believe that the current living arrangement is in (the teen\'s) best interest."\n\nCiting the teen\'s mental state, Brinkman said, "it does not appear that this child is even close to being able to make such a life-altering decision at this time."\n\n"If the maternal grandparents were to be given custody, it would simply be a way for the child to circumvent the necessity of parents\' consent," Brinkman said. "[The] Parents believe custody of the child should be restored to them, so they can make the medical decisions they believe are in their child\'s best interest until [the child] turns 18 years of age."\n\nBut Donald Clancy of the Hamilton County Prosecutor\'s Office argued that the reason why the parents don\'t want their child to receive hormone replacement therapy is because it is also against their religious beliefs. "Father testified that any kind of transition at all would go against his core beliefs and allowing the child to transition would be akin to him taking his heart out of his chest and placing it on the table," according to a transcript of Clancy\'s closing argument.\n\nClancy said that although the father testified he "fully accepts" his child, he also testified that having the teen come home would "warp" his siblings\' perception of reality.\n\nHamilton County Job and Family Services temporarily placed the teen in his grandparents\' home after the child had been hospitalized.\n\nIn November 2016, the teen had contacted a crisis chat service to say he felt unsafe in his parents\' home, according to the complaint. The teen reported that his father told him to kill himself, because he was "going to hell anyway," according to a transcript of the closing arguments.\n\nThe complaint further states that an investigation found that the parents temporarily stopped their child\'s mental health counseling. And the therapist got an email from the mother saying they were seeking "Christian" therapy instead. The teen said he was forced to sit in a room and listen to Bible readings for over six hours at a time, according to the complaint.\n\nThe parents\' attorney denied the allegations in court. Brinkman said the parents\' objection to medical treatment, particularly hormone treatment, for "this gender thing" does not come solely from their religious belief. Brinkman argued that they "have done their due diligence contacting medical professionals, collecting thousands of hours of research and relying on ... their observation of their own child ... that led them to the conclusion that this is not in their child\'s best interest."\n\nIn her written argument, she said the teen\'s parents don\'t believe the hormones are a "medically necessary form of treatment" and feel the treatment "would do more harm than good."\n\nThe teen\'s lawyer, Thomas Mellott, said his parents had him enrolled at a Catholic school where he was made to wear dresses and answer to his birth name.\n\n"It caused additional trauma and anxiety," Mellott said. "When you lack all hope, and when he thought this would all continue to happen to him, the suicidal ideation became more pronounced, and that is how he ended up where he was."\n\nThe grandparents\' attorney, Jeffrey Cutcher, told the court he would also like the grandparents to help the child legally change his name, as even seeing his birth name on documents has caused trauma.\n\n"The name has become a very big trigger," Mellott said. "It has gotten to the point where my client mentioned that he doesn\'t want to think about college at this point because the marketing materials he\'s getting keep using the birth name.\n\n"He gets really good grades. He is academically inclined and participates in the band and was really engaged in school, and then all the sudden, this happened," the attorney said. "It\'s been incredibly hard."\n\nThe grandparents\' attorney argued that the court needed to act quickly.\n\n"What we want to do in the coming months around May is plan for a high school graduation, throughout the summer and fall, plan for entrance into college. We don\'t want to be planning for a funeral," Cutcher said in his closing argument.\n\n"There is really strong data that says supporting an authentic child decreases future health risks," said Dr. Michelle Forcier , a pediatrician who is not involved in this case but works with transgender patients, some as young as 4 years old. She is also an associate professor of pediatrics at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University.\n\n"Parents or other family members don\'t have to understand, but they do have to say \'I love you and support you, and let\'s get this figured out together.\' "\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nCorinne Green , policy coordinator for the Transgender Law Center , said "this is a really critical time in a child\'s life, and it can be frustrating for the process to take so long to help him. There can be significant harm in delaying or withholding care of any kind." Her group is also not involved in the case\n\nWithholding or delaying treatment, studies show, can lead to anxiety, depression and suicidality.\n\n"If your child had asthma and was turning blue, you wouldn\'t deny them their albuterol inhaler or say \'let\'s wait,\' " Forcier said. "If this were cancer or diabetes, we wouldn\'t be having this conversation, but people get funny when it comes to medical care when gender is involved, and that\'s harmful."\n\nThe juvenile court judge, calling it "obviously a gut-wrenching situation for all of you to face," has said she will issue a ruling by Friday.'), (2, 'Kelly Wallace is CNN\'s digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life.

You get an easy and honest conversation that speaks volumes about how we can talk to our kids about gender and how much we can learn from their openness.\n\n"What gender do you think I am?" Hennessy asked 11 sixth-graders in New York Citywho are members of SheKnows\' unique Hatch program , which focuses on teaching digital literacy and citizenship to the next generation. The program is in its fourth year.\n\nThere is silence for a second, and then one girl says "male" and another says, "I heard earlier that you were transgender."\n\nHennessy, an actor in New York City and co-host of the podcast " Kill Me Now" with comedian Judy Gold, says they are both right.\n\n"I\'m a transgender male," he says.\n\nAnd then the questions begin. "When did you first realize you were transgender?" a boy asks before the conversation turns to terms the kids may or may not have heard before: transgender, agender (when you don\'t identify as male or female), gender fluid (you feel more masculine one day, more feminine the next) and sexual orientation.\n\n\'Don\'t treat it like a gross, icky ... thing\'\n\nHennessy hopes the new video of the Hatch workshop, released Thursday, will be seen by children and parents across the country and lead to more understanding about people like himself who are born with reproductive organs that do not match their gender identity.\n\n"If you don\'t treat it like a gross, icky, weird, evil thing, they don\'t treat it like a gross, icky, weird, evil thing," Hennessy said in an interview. When kids as young as 4 or 5 years old use female pronouns when they meet him, he tells them, "Oh, no, I\'m a boy," at which point they often ask, "What, you\'re a boy?"\n\nHe then explains to them what being transgender is. "And boom, they get it right away," he said.\n\nMaverick, 12, knew what transgender was before taking part in the Hatch workshop. His mom is a sexuality educator who has been talking to him about sexuality and gender since birth. But he had never met anyone who was transgender until Hennessy.\n\n"I thought it was a very powerful experience for me," Maverick said. "I\'m not sure about other kids, but I think meeting a transgender male for the first time was a very impactful thing in my life."\n\nThe experience gives him a better understanding of how other people think, he said. "I think it just tells me more about others and how to act with them and respect them in different ways."\n\nReed, who\'s also 12 and participated in the workshop, said it\'s very helpful to meet and talk with someone who is transgender or watch them in a video.\n\n"It\'s not just like learning from maybe people who don\'t know that much about that," she said. "You\'re learning from people who have experienced it."\n\n\'Just Google it\'\n\nLogan Levkoff is a sexuality educator who has taught and designed many of the sex education programs used in private schools throughout New York City and the surrounding areas. She is also the mother of Maverick and an 8-year-old daughter. Gender is a constant conversation in their household.\n\n"We\'ve always spent a lot of time talking about what it means to be a boy and what it means to be a girl and maybe more importantly, the fact that there is not one definition of boy and girl and anything in between," said Levkoff, author of "Got Teens? The Doctor Moms\' Guide to Sexuality, Social Media and Other Adolescent Realities."\n\nShe has told her kids that every person has the right to experience life the way they see fit, in a way that best reflects who they are. "And sometimes that means not feeling like a boy or not feeling like a girl or feeling like something else entirely," she said.\n\nHer advice for parents, when it comes to how and when to start talking to kids about what it means to be transgender and gender in general, is to first figure out what exactly they want their kids to know and then recognize what their own limitations are and the gaps in their own knowledge.\n\n"The likelihood is that for a lot of parents, they may not have any personal experience, which means that you have to get some information and education and also be willing to tell your child, if they have a question for you, to say, \'You know what, I don\'t know what the answer is, but I\'m going to find it out for you,\' " said Levkoff.\n\nHennessy, who grew up in Maui, Hawaii, at a time when there was no dialogue about being transgender, said parents should absolutely take time to learn more about it.\n\n"Just Google it. Google transgender. Google transsexual. Google tranny, and it won\'t take that long," he said. "Just learn a little bit. All you\'ve got to do is start. You don\'t have to learn everything all at once ... It\'s a lot simpler than people try to make it, so we have all these definitions and words to define things, but it\'s really super simple. ... We overthink it."\n\nHennessy didn\'t hear the term transgender until roughly five years ago. Before that, he always felt "off," he said. "I felt totally born wrong since day one." Ashamed about being in a woman\'s body, he had bound his breasts ever since he started developing. "I would wear two sports bras and one of my dad\'s extra-large shirts ... and any time the wind blew up against me, I would pull my shirt up off of my chest."\n\nHow parents can learn from their kids\n\nLike Levkoff, Hennessy can\'t emphasize enough how the more honest and open you are with your child about sexuality and gender, the better.\n\n"I say, as soon as they start asking you, answer the questions, no matter how old they are, as soon as they start asking you, because if you don\'t answer them, someone else will, and you can choose what they hear first," he said. "It takes the mysticism out of sex. It takes the pervertedness out of sex."\n\n"There are some young kids who are really capable of some really sophisticated thought about gender and sexuality, and there are some adults who are completely incapable of having a mature conversation, so age doesn\'t determine whether or not someone can handle this, but I think it\'s important for parents to remember that from the time our kids are born, how we dress them, how we allow them to express themselves, how we allow other people to talk to them or the assumptions they make about them, are all little doses of education about gender and expression," she said.\n\nWhat is clear, at least from the video featuring Hennessy and the Hatch participants, is that there\'s a lot parents can learn from kids, especially about topics such as gender.\n\n"I think parents should learn from kids, because kids are more exposed to all this stuff now ... and parents, their generation wasn\'t as exposed," said Reed, one of the young participants. "It shouldn\'t just be kids learning from parents. It should go all ways."\n\nLevkoff said she is "constantly amazed" at how "color- and gender-blind" today\'s kids are. "And by the way, not all of them, because they are a product of us," she said. "But their default setting isn\'t to be intolerant. Their default setting is to just be open, and that\'s really an incredible thing to watch."\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nHennessy said most parents teach their kids to love equally and to eschew racism. He hopes they will also find ways to teach them to be open and accepting of another person\'s gender.\n\n"When someone is coming to you with something that is different from your experience, just give them a chance to tell their side and believe them and don\'t try to change them, because by trying to change them, you\'re telling them that their existence isn\'t good enough," Hennessy said.'), (3, '(CNN) More teenagers are identifying themselves with nontraditional gender labels such as transgender or gender-fluid, according to a new study.\n\nThe research, published Monday in the journal Pediatrics , found that almost 3% of Minnesota teens did not identify with traditional gender labels such as "boy" or "girl." That number is higher than researchers expected. A UCLA study from a year ago estimated that 0.7% of teens identified as transgender.\n\nLead researcher Nic Rider of the University of Minnesota said the main purpose of the new study was to examine health differences between gender-nonconforming teens and teens who are cisgender, a person whose gender identity aligns with the sex assigned to them at birth.\n\nThe study found that transgender and gender-nonconforming (TGNC) youth reported "reported significantly poorer health" -- including mental health -- than cisgender teenagers. TGNC teens also were less likely to get preventive health checkups and more likely to visit their school nurse, the study found.\n\nBut more surprising may have been the rising percentage of teens who say they don\'t fit traditional gender norms.\n\nRead More')]
