Fake News is a news aggregation program developed for CS 115 at UCSC by:

Our program fundamentally uses LSI matrix similiarity queries to attempt
to filter out the subjectivity seen in many news articles. The theory is 
that if there are numerous articles about the same topic the only sentences
that are re-iterated across all sources are more likely to be objective and
less biased. Whereas, sentences which are said in only one source are more 
likely to be the opinion of the author of that specific source rather than
objective fact.

The data is presented to the user in a helpful GUI. To run the program 
first run fnGUI.py using python3 (python2 is not supported). Within the 
GUI click collect articles to pull articles from all the news sites 
mentioned in the sitelist.txt file. There are multiple txt files for 
different categories. After collecting articles, the user should press the 
aggregate button to compile them and use LSI to extract the top 5 topics
in the given corpus. The buttons below aggregate will then provide a list
of the most related articles, or the most related sentences + a summary
depending on if you press articles or summary respectively. 

The user can also search for the most matched sentences for a custom query
using the 'Search terms' input box and the 'Search' button. The user can
also find articles similar to an article they find by using the 
'Article URL' input box and the 'URL Search' push button. Lastly, the user
can change to a different category using the categories drop down menu. 
Currently only All and Politics are supported. These instructions can be
seen again in Help > Show Usage of the GUI.

This program is set up as a framework that can be easily modified for further
use as a source of personal news or as a research tool.
